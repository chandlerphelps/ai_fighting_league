### 1. "WHISPER" — Lien Zhao
**Age 22 / Hanoi, Vietnam / Tweener / Prodigy-Mystic**

**Physical Description:**
- **Height/Weight:** 5'1" / 112 lbs
- **Build:** Tiny, whip-thin, deceptively muscular calves and forearms. Dancer's posture.
- **Skin:** Warm bronze
- **Hair:** Jet black, cropped asymmetrically — shaved on the left side, chin-length on the right, with a single streak of white running through it
- **Eyes:** Dark brown, almost black. Unnervingly still when she's reading an opponent.
- **Distinguishing Features:** Faded white scarring across both palms (ritual cuts). A small lotus tattoo behind her left ear that glows faintly cyan when she channels chi.
- **Ring Attire:** White bandage wraps on hands and forearms, a cropped black sports halter that shows her midriff, high-cut black compression shorts with white piping, barefoot
- **Entrance Style:** Walks out in total silence. No music. No expression. The crowd goes quiet instinctively.

**Abilities:**
Whisper fights with chi-augmented Wing Chun blended with Muay Boran, channeling energy through precise strikes to equalize against larger opponents. Chi mastery is her primary weapon and defining edge — she reads energy, redirects force, and hits pressure points with eerie precision. What makes her unsettling isn't glowing hands — it's the stillness. A 112-pound woman with no expression dismantling someone twice her size, never rushing, never flinching. She excels as a counter-striker, dismantling aggression with patience and flow. Her finishing move, "The Silence," is a devastating chi palm strike to the sternum delivered from a trance-like evasion state — opponents drop like their strings were cut. Her weaknesses are grapplers who can close distance and smother her, and emotional disruption, which breaks her chi connection and leaves her fighting as a small woman with no supernatural edge.

**Image Generation Notes:**
Pixel art portrait: Small, intense young woman with asymmetric black hair (shaved left, jaw-length right with white streak). Bronze skin, dark piercing eyes — unnervingly still, like she's already read you. White hand wraps, black cropped halter top, black high-cut shorts. Glowing cyan lotus tattoo behind left ear. Barefoot. Expression: calm, watchful, eerily composed for someone about to fight. Background: dark, minimal — the focus is her stillness.

### 2. "SABLE" — Morrigan Vex
**Age 26 / Dublin, Ireland / Tweener / Technician-Mystic**

**Physical Description:**
- **Height/Weight:** 5'6" / 142 lbs
- **Build:** Lean and angular, long limbs for her frame. Athletic but not bulky — a fencer's build.
- **Skin:** Pale, almost porcelain, with light freckles across the nose and shoulders
- **Hair:** Deep auburn-red, pulled back in a tight braid that reaches mid-back. Loose strands frame her face.
- **Eyes:** Left eye is pale green. Right eye is noticeably darker — almost olive. Unsettling up close.
- **Distinguishing Features:** Celtic knotwork tattoos covering both arms from shoulder to wrist. The ink appears to shift and writhe subtly in low light. A thin scar running from her right eyebrow down to her cheekbone.
- **Ring Attire:** Dark emerald green sports bra with Celtic knot trim, matching high-cut bottoms with a half-skirt on the left hip, black leather hand wraps with silver clasps, barefoot
- **Entrance Style:** Walks out to the sound of a lone fiddle. Eyes scan the crowd like she's looking for someone.

**Abilities:**
Sable is an outfighter and counter-striker who pairs chi-augmented bare-knuckle boxing with an almost precognitive sense for incoming attacks — her chi lets her read strikes before they're thrown. She slips between combinations with impossible precision, making brawlers miss by millimeters before answering with devastating counters. Her unsettling mismatched eyes and the way she stares through you — the eerie confidence of someone who's already seen how this ends — cause momentary hesitation in opponents. It's unnerving beauty and calm, not magic; she just makes you feel like prey. Her finishing move, "Blackout Waltz," is a three-hit combination (slip, liver shot, delayed head kick) that only comes out when she's fully downloaded the opponent. Her weaknesses are pressure fighters who get inside her range and overwhelm her chi sense, and emotional disruption — mentions of The Ashen Circle crack her composure.

**Image Generation Notes:**
Pixel art portrait: Lean, angular woman with pale freckled skin and a tight auburn-red braid. Heterochromatic eyes — left pale green, right dark olive — captivating and unsettling, the kind of eyes you can't look away from and can't hold either. Thin scar from right eyebrow to cheekbone. Celtic knotwork sleeve tattoos on both arms. Dark emerald green sports bra with Celtic trim, matching high-cut bottoms with half-skirt on left hip, black leather hand wraps. Expression: guarded, calculating — beauty that makes you uncomfortable rather than attracted. Background: misty dark green with faint Celtic knot patterns.

### 3. "GOLDEN BOY" — Mateo Reyes
**Age 21 / Mexico City, Mexico / Face / Prodigy-Legacy**

**Physical Description:**
- **Height/Weight:** 5'8" / 144 lbs
- **Build:** Sculpted, magazine-cover physique. Broad shoulders, tapered waist, defined everything. He knows it.
- **Skin:** Rich warm brown
- **Hair:** Thick black, styled in a swept-back taper fade. Always camera-ready.
- **Eyes:** Honey brown, expressive. His emotions play across his face in real-time.
- **Distinguishing Features:** A gold crucifix pendant he kisses before fights (given by his grandmother). Perfect teeth. A small beauty mark on his left jaw.
- **Ring Attire:** Gold and white trunks with "REYES" stitched down the side, gold hand wraps, white boxing boots with gold laces
- **Entrance Style:** Full showman. Mariachi band intro that transitions into hip-hop. Works the crowd, shadowboxes, blows kisses. The arena loves him.

**Abilities:**
Golden Boy fights with Mexican-style pressure boxing — relentless forward movement, devastating body work, and a pull-counter right hand inherited from his legendary father "El Toro." His signature bull-rush combination, "La Corrida," storms opponents behind a jab before unleashing hooks to the body. His finishing move, "El Toro's Ghost," is a leaping overhand right thrown from an impossible angle that analysts can't find in any training footage — it's exactly the way his father threw it. His weaknesses are an untested chin, counter-strikers who can make him pay for his aggression, and psychological warfare — he wears his heart on his sleeve and rattles easily.

**Image Generation Notes:**
Pixel art portrait: Young, strikingly handsome man with rich brown skin, swept-back black hair (taper fade), honey-brown eyes, beauty mark on left jaw. Sculpted athletic build — broad shoulders, bare chested, defined abs. Gold and white boxing trunks with "REYES" on the side, gold hand wraps, white boots with gold laces. Gold crucifix pendant. Expression: confident grin, showman energy. Background: warm gold with spotlight effect.

### 4. "THE DUCHESS" — Dominique St. Claire
**Age 29 / Lyon, France / Heel / Seductress-Technician**

**Physical Description:**
- **Height/Weight:** 5'7" / 155 lbs
- **Build:** Statuesque, long-legged, hourglass figure with lean, toned muscle. Every inch deliberate.
- **Skin:** Fair olive with a warm undertone
- **Hair:** Platinum blonde, worn loose and flowing during entrances, tied in a high ponytail for fights. Not a strand out of place.
- **Eyes:** Ice blue, heavy-lidded, perpetually amused — a gaze that makes you feel like she's undressing your game plan. Her eyes are weapons because of her expression, not magic
- **Distinguishing Features:** A beauty mark above her upper lip on the right side. Long, manicured nails even during fights (reinforced — they're a weapon). A delicate gold chain anklet she never removes.
- **Ring Attire:** White high-cut leotard with a deep plunging neckline and gold filigree trim, sheer thigh-high stockings, white fighting gloves with gold clasps. Looks like she's going to a gala, not a cage fight.
- **Entrance Style:** Classical music — Debussy's "Clair de Lune." She walks like she's on a runway, barely acknowledging the crowd. Blows a single kiss to the camera before the bell.

**Abilities:**
The Duchess fights with savate and judo, delivered with surgical elegance that makes violence look like ballet. Seduction is her primary psychological weapon — opponents hesitate, lose focus, and drop their guard, unable to reconcile her beauty with her brutality. She's wearing a white leotard with a plunging neckline and sheer thigh-highs and smirking at you while she picks you apart — the distraction is built into every deliberate choice she makes. Her strikes have a surgically precise, demoralizing quality — she doesn't just hit you, she makes you feel stupid for getting hit. Her finishing move, "Bonsoir," is a feinted low kick that draws the guard down followed by a razor-sharp high kick to the temple — she mouths "bonsoir" right before it lands. Her weaknesses are pressure wrestling and ground fighting — if someone pins her down, the elegance disappears and she panics.

**Image Generation Notes:**
Pixel art portrait: Tall, statuesque woman with fair olive skin, platinum blonde hair in a high ponytail, ice-blue heavy-lidded eyes, beauty mark above right lip. Hourglass figure, toned and elegant. White high-cut leotard with deep V-neckline and gold filigree trim, sheer thigh-highs, white gloves with gold clasps, gold ankle chain. The outfit is the statement — she's the most visually scandalous fighter on the roster and she knows it. Expression: amused, slightly condescending smirk — the smirk does more work than any glow effect could. Background: deep royal purple with gold accents, chandelier-like light.

### 5. "SWITCHBLADE" — Dion Okafor
**Age 27 / Lagos, Nigeria → London, England / Face (reluctant) / Wildcard-Survivor**

**Physical Description:**
- **Height/Weight:** 5'10" / 163 lbs
- **Build:** Rangy, wiry-strong. Not the biggest or most muscular, but every muscle fiber is functional. Long arms for his frame.
- **Skin:** Deep dark brown
- **Hair:** Short locs, bleached gold at the tips
- **Eyes:** Near-black, sharp and restless. Always scanning.
- **Distinguishing Features:** A keloid scar running diagonally across his left pectoral (knife wound from his teenage years). Geometric tribal tattoo on right shoulder. Missing the tip of his left pinky finger.
- **Ring Attire:** Black compression shorts, red hand wraps taped up past the wrists, black ankle wraps, barefoot. No frills.
- **Entrance Style:** Grime music, heavy bass. Bounces out loose and fluid, cracking his neck, rolling his shoulders. Touches gloves with his corner, no eye contact with the opponent until the bell.

**Abilities:**
Switchblade fights with sharp, efficient London-style boxing combined with dirty MMA learned on the streets and in underground warehouse fights. His signature "Switch" — a stance-switch into a straight left hand — catches orthodox-trained opponents clean with its bizarre angle. In the clinch, his "Gutter Knee" is a short, vicious body knee thrown from an almost undefendable angle. His finishing move, "Lights Out South," is a pull-counter left hook thrown mid-stance-switch that has ended eight fights. His weaknesses are high-level grapplers who can get him down (his submission defense is limited) and significantly bigger fighters — he relies on speed and precision, not power.

**Image Generation Notes:**
Pixel art portrait: Rangy, wiry man with deep dark brown skin, short black locs with gold-bleached tips. Sharp, restless near-black eyes. Keloid scar diagonal across left pec, geometric tribal tattoo on right shoulder. Shirtless, black compression shorts, red hand wraps taped past the wrists, barefoot. Missing tip of left pinky. Expression: focused, coiled intensity. Background: dark red with gritty urban texture, exposed brick feel.

### 6. "ICON" — Adonis Cole
**Age 30 / Atlanta, GA, USA / Face (trending tweener) / Veteran-Seductor**

**Physical Description:**
- **Height/Weight:** 6'1" / 183 lbs
- **Build:** Greek-god physique. Broad chest, carved shoulders, narrow waist, powerful thighs. The kind of body that stops traffic.
- **Skin:** Deep brown with a warm undertone
- **Hair:** Kept in a clean high-top fade with a precise lineup
- **Eyes:** Dark brown, intense but warm. Knows exactly how to use them.
- **Distinguishing Features:** Full sleeve tattoo on left arm — a lion emerging from roses and thorns. A thin scar bisecting his left eyebrow. Jawline sharp enough to cut glass.
- **Ring Attire:** Black trunks with gold lion emblem, black and gold hand wraps, black boots. Simple, expensive-looking.
- **Entrance Style:** R&B intro that drops into heavy trap. Walks out shirtless with a towel over his shoulders. Makes eye contact with the camera like he's on a magazine cover. The crowd — especially the women — loses it.

**Abilities:**
Icon is an MMA wrestler with devastating top control, ground-and-pound, and a suffocating clinch game. His explosive level-change double-leg takedown, "The Takeover," looks like a car accident, and from mount his short elbows ("Crown Jewel") are surgically precise. His finishing move, "Icon's End," is a slam from the clinch into immediate mount followed by ground-and-pound so precise and relentless the referee has no choice but to stop it. His weaknesses are pure strikers who can keep him at range and punish his entries, accumulated chin damage over 30 fights, and the fact that if he can't get the fight to the ground he becomes a good-not-great kickboxer facing specialists.

**Image Generation Notes:**
Pixel art portrait: Tall, powerfully built man with deep brown skin, high-top fade with sharp lineup, intense dark brown eyes, scar through left eyebrow. Jawline chiseled. Full left-arm sleeve tattoo (lion, roses, thorns). Bare-chested, black trunks with gold lion emblem, black and gold hand wraps, black boots. Championship belt over one shoulder. Expression: confident but with an edge — a king who senses threats. Background: black and gold, spotlight from above.

### 7. "VESPER" — Natasha Loskova
**Age 25 / Saint Petersburg, Russia / Tweener (leaning heel) / Experiment-Seductress**

**Physical Description:**
- **Height/Weight:** 5'9" / 175 lbs
- **Build:** Athletic hourglass — broad shoulders, full bust, narrow waist, powerful hips and thighs. Unusually proportioned, like she was designed rather than born.
- **Skin:** Pale ivory, almost luminous
- **Hair:** Silver-white, straight, worn loose and flowing past her shoulders. It moves slightly even when there's no wind.
- **Eyes:** Pale violet — not contacts. They catch light strangely, almost reflective.
- **Distinguishing Features:** Faint circuit-like scarring on both temples, usually hidden by her hair. When she exerts herself, veins on her forearms glow faintly blue-white. Her body temperature runs noticeably cold.
- **Ring Attire:** Charcoal grey sling bikini top with silver hardware, matching high-cut bottoms, fingerless grey gloves that extend to mid-forearm, barefoot. Minimal, clinical, designed to distract.
- **Entrance Style:** Low, pulsing electronic music. She walks out expressionless, eyes glowing faintly in the arena lights. The temperature near the cage seems to drop. The crowd doesn't cheer — they hold their breath.

**Abilities:**
Vesper fights with combat sambo enhanced by Project Zarya modifications — throws, joint locks, and strikes augmented by inhuman strength and reflexes. Her psychic flashes let her anticipate attacks a half-second before they're thrown, creating an eerie sense that she knows what's coming. Her designed beauty is weaponized — her proportions are too perfect, like a face from an ad you can't look away from. She moves too smoothly, and her blank expression makes opponents project whatever they fear onto her. The distraction is uncanny valley, not mystical emanation; something about her just doesn't sit right, and that half-second of unease costs you. Her finishing move, "Zarya Protocol," is an acceleration beyond normal human speed into a combination (armbar from clinch into choke transition) so fast the audience barely sees it. Her weaknesses are fighters with high mental fortitude who resist her psychic edge, and overload — when pushed past her limits, her enhancements glitch, causing freezes and lost seconds.

**Image Generation Notes:**
Pixel art portrait: Tall, athletic hourglass figure with pale ivory luminous skin, straight silver-white hair past shoulders (seems to float slightly), striking pale violet eyes with faint reflective quality. Faint circuit-like scars at temples — the contrast between the beautiful face and the circuit scars is the visual hook. Charcoal grey sling bikini top with silver hardware, matching high-cut bottoms, fingerless grey mid-forearm gloves. Faint blue-white glow in forearm veins. Too-perfect proportions, cold clinical beauty. Expression: blank, beautiful, unsettling — disturbing, not enchanting. Background: cold steel blue with faint static/digital distortion effects.

### 8. "OLD TESTAMENT" — Ezekiel Crowe
**Age 41 / Appalachian Mountains, West Virginia, USA / Tweener / Veteran-Mystic**

**Physical Description:**
- **Height/Weight:** 6'3" / 218 lbs
- **Build:** Weathered muscle — not pretty, not sculpted, but dense and hard like old wood. Thick neck, heavy hands, barrel chest. A body built by decades of hard living and harder fighting.
- **Skin:** Ruddy, sun-damaged, weathered tan
- **Hair:** Grey-streaked dark brown, grown out to collar length, usually pushed back and wild
- **Eyes:** Pale grey, deeply set under heavy brows. Preacher's eyes — they look through you.
- **Distinguishing Features:** Heavy scarring on both fists from decades of bare-knuckle fighting. A faded tattoo of a serpent coiling around a cross on his right forearm. Deep crow's feet and a jaw like a cinder block.
- **Ring Attire:** Worn black jeans, no shirt, bare knuckles (wraps only when required), heavy work boots that he refuses to trade for fight shoes
- **Entrance Style:** No music. He walks out carrying a worn leather-bound book (never opens it). Sets it in his corner. Stares at his opponent until the bell.

**Abilities:**
Old Testament fights with patient, upright bare-knuckle boxing and grinding Appalachian catch wrestling — an old-school style refined by four decades of violence. His metronomic jab, "The Sermon," punishes opponents over rounds until they're broken, building damage like a slow sermon building to its point. His standing arm-crank from the clinch, "Serpent's Coil," feels less like a wrestling hold and more like he's trying to tear a limb off. His finishing move, "Judgment Day," is a single right hand thrown with his full weight from a dead stop — no setup, no combination, just the punch. It has ended 15 careers. His weaknesses are speed (young, fast fighters outpoint him from the outside), fading cardio in later rounds, and accumulating injuries — his left knee is held together by stubbornness.

**Image Generation Notes:**
Pixel art portrait: Tall, weathered, barrel-chested man in his 40s. Ruddy sun-worn skin, grey-streaked dark brown hair pushed back wildly, pale grey deep-set eyes under heavy brows. Cinder-block jaw, crow's feet, heavy scarring on fists. Serpent-and-cross tattoo on right forearm. Shirtless, worn black jeans, heavy work boots. Expression: implacable, righteous calm. Background: dark with faint amber candlelight glow, storm clouds.

### 9. "NEON" — Jake Morrison
**Age 24 / San Jose, California, USA / Face / Prodigy-Experiment**

**Physical Description:**
- **Height/Weight:** 6'0" / 195 lbs
- **Build:** Athletic and broad-shouldered, powerful thighs, tight waist. College quarterback meets Olympic athlete. Muscular but proportioned for aesthetics.
- **Skin:** Fair, light tan from outdoor training
- **Hair:** Sandy brown, styled in a modern textured undercut. Dyed neon-blue streak on the right side.
- **Eyes:** Blue-green, bright, expressive. Smiles with his eyes before his mouth catches up.
- **Distinguishing Features:** Subdermal LED implants along both forearms that glow neon blue during high exertion (courtesy of Halo Labs). A geometric eagle tattoo across his upper back. Dimples. Clean-cut jawline.
- **Ring Attire:** White and electric-blue fight shorts with holographic trim, blue hand wraps, white sneaker-style fight shoes. Clean, futuristic, branded.
- **Entrance Style:** Custom EDM track drops as he jogs out, shadowboxing to the beat, LED forearms pulsing. Works the crowd with a natural charisma that doesn't feel rehearsed. The most marketable fighter in the league and he knows it.

**Abilities:**
Neon fights with devastating taekwondo — blindingly fast kicks, spinning techniques, and elite range management — supplemented by a sharp jab and hooks developed after his transition from the Olympic taekwondo track. His "Blue Lightning" roundhouse from southpaw is so fast his LED forearms seem to trail light, and his "Firewall" defensive combination shuts down opponent offense completely for an exchange. His finishing move, "Neon Knockout," is a spinning back kick to the body that folds opponents, followed immediately by a flying knee as they double over — the LEDs flare at impact and highlight reels worship it. His weaknesses are elite wrestlers who can close the kicking distance and take him down, and championship rounds — his output drops when the fight goes long.

**Image Generation Notes:**
Pixel art portrait: Athletic, broad-shouldered young man with fair lightly tanned skin, sandy brown textured undercut hair with neon-blue streak on right side. Bright blue-green eyes, dimples, clean jawline. Geometric eagle tattoo across upper back. Shirtless, white and electric-blue fight shorts with holographic trim, blue hand wraps, white fight shoes. Glowing neon-blue LED lines running along both forearms. Expression: confident, bright grin. Background: electric blue and white, digital/holographic particle effects.

### 10. "THE BUTCHER OF BOGOTA" — Hernán Cárdenas
**Age 35 / Bogotá, Colombia / Heel / Monster-Veteran**

**Physical Description:**
- **Height/Weight:** 6'6" / 278 lbs
- **Build:** Massive, thick, built for function over form. Huge traps, cannonball shoulders, a gut that hides slabs of core muscle underneath. Not lean — terrifying.
- **Skin:** Olive brown, heavily weathered
- **Hair:** Shaved to the skin. A network of thin scars on his scalp tells the story.
- **Eyes:** Dark brown, small and deep-set in a broad face. Dead calm. Like looking into a wall.
- **Distinguishing Features:** Heavy scar tissue around both eyes from cuts. A crude tattoo of a bull skull covering his entire upper back. His hands are enormous — closed, each fist is the size of a cantaloupe. Missing two teeth on the left side (refuses replacements).
- **Ring Attire:** Plain black fight shorts, no shirt, no wraps, no shoes. Tape around both wrists, nothing else.
- **Entrance Style:** No music, no fanfare. He just appears in the cage like he was already there. The crowd boos and he doesn't blink.

**Abilities:**
The Butcher fights with raw, experience-refined brawling and smothering clinch work — no formal name for his style, just violence distilled by decades of real danger. His looping left hook, "The Butcher's Hook," carries his full 278 lbs behind it and doesn't need to be technical. Against the cage, his "La Prensa" pins opponents and methodically destroys their body with short punches and knees. His finishing move, "The Killing Floor," is a two-handed head grab into a single devastating knee to the face — the ugliest, most effective finish in the league. His weaknesses are speed (mobile strikers stick and move all night), a limited gas tank (if he doesn't finish in three rounds, he fades), and instinct-based takedown defense that elite grapplers can exploit.

**Image Generation Notes:**
Pixel art portrait: Massive, towering man (6'6") with olive-brown weathered skin, completely shaved scarred scalp, small deep-set dark brown eyes in a broad flat face. Heavy scar tissue around eyes, missing teeth left side. Enormous fists, tape around wrists. Crude bull skull tattoo on upper back. Shirtless, plain black fight shorts, barefoot. No expression. Background: dark blood-red, smoky, industrial.

### 11. "KAIDA" — Yuki Tanaka
**Age 28 / Osaka, Japan / Face / Mystic-Monster**

**Physical Description:**
- **Height/Weight:** 6'4" / 260 lbs
- **Build:** Massive and sculpted like a temple guardian statue. Huge, defined chest and arms, thick waist, tree-trunk legs. Imposing but proportioned — the body of a strongman who also trains aesthetics.
- **Skin:** Warm tan
- **Hair:** Long, thick, jet black, worn loose past his shoulders. It moves in combat like it has weight and life.
- **Eyes:** Amber-gold — not natural. They changed color after his awakening at The Iron Temple.
- **Distinguishing Features:** A full-body irezumi (traditional Japanese tattoo) covering his back, both arms, and chest — a massive dragon wreathed in storm clouds, done in traditional tebori (hand-poked) style. The tattoo seems to ripple when he's channeling power. A prominent brow ridge and strong jaw give him a fierce, almost oni-like appearance.
- **Ring Attire:** Black traditional Japanese-style trunks tied with a crimson obi sash, barefoot. The irezumi tattoo IS the spectacle.
- **Entrance Style:** Taiko drums. He walks out performing a slow, deliberate sumo-style ritual: the salt toss, the stomps, the clap. The arena shakes. When the drums peak, his tattoo pulses with faint amber light and the crowd erupts.

**Abilities:**
Kaida fights with sumo-influenced striking — devastating palm strikes, overpowering charges, and thrusts — augmented by elemental chi channeling with a fire aspect. His "Dragon's Palm" is an open-palm chest strike that blasts opponents backward with impossible concussive thermal force, and his "Tectonic Stamp" sends a shockwave through the cage floor that disrupts footing. His finishing move, "Ryujin's Wrath," fully ignites his irezumi tattoo with amber-gold light as he delivers a headbutt followed by an overhead double-palm strike that creates a visible concussive blast — the most spectacular finish in the league. His weaknesses are speed and precision strikers who stay at range, degraded technique when the dragon activates (more powerful but more predictable), and exhaustion from heavy channeling — a long fight against a disciplined opponent drains him.

**Image Generation Notes:**
Pixel art portrait: Massive, sculpted man (6'4", 260 lbs) with warm tan skin, long flowing black hair past shoulders, striking amber-gold glowing eyes. Prominent brow, strong jaw, fierce but noble face. Full traditional Japanese irezumi tattoo (dragon in storm clouds) covering back, arms, and chest — tattoo pulses with amber light. Black Japanese-style trunks with crimson obi sash, barefoot. Expression: calm intensity, power barely contained. Background: deep crimson with amber energy wisps, faint taiko-drum visual motif.

### 12. "CARRION KING" — Unknown
**Age Unknown (appears mid-30s) / Unknown / Heel (chaotic) / Monster-Wildcard**

**Physical Description:**
- **Height/Weight:** 6'5" / 248 lbs
- **Build:** Nightmarish. Asymmetric — left arm and shoulder are significantly larger and more muscular than the right, as if his body grew wrong. Hunched posture, long arms, thick core. Not a bodybuilder's physique — a predator's.
- **Skin:** Ashen grey-white, sickly pallid, threaded with dark veins visible beneath the surface
- **Hair:** None. Completely hairless. Scalp is covered in raised scar tissue forming patterns that might be intentional.
- **Eyes:** No visible iris — solid milky white with pinprick black pupils. They dilate independently.
- **Distinguishing Features:** His mouth is wrong. Too wide, and when he grins his teeth are visibly filed to points. Thick, ropy scarring across his torso like he was opened up and stitched back together by someone who didn't care about cosmetics. His fingernails are dark, thick, and pointed. A low, rattling sound comes from his chest when he breathes hard — something mechanical or organic in there that isn't standard anatomy.
- **Ring Attire:** Tattered black cargo pants, barefoot, no shirt, no wraps. He doesn't dress for fights. He shows up like this.
- **Entrance Style:** The lights die. All of them. The arena goes black for five full seconds. When they come back, he's already in the cage. No one has ever seen him walk in. The crowd screams. He grins.

**Abilities:**
Carrion King fights with feral, predatory instinct refined by what might be decades or centuries of combat — a style that resembles the oldest, most brutal form of Pankration. His "Feast" is a deliberate absorption of clean hits that activates his blood rage, turning damage into escalating power. In the clinch, "The Whisper" — whatever he says to opponents — has caused three fighters to quit on their stool. His finishing move, "Carrion Call," is a berserker combination thrown with zero defensive concern: he walks through everything and delivers savage hammer fists, elbows, and headbutts until the fight is stopped, his eyes fully white and the rattling in his chest audible to the front row. His weaknesses are disciplined, patient fighters who refuse to engage emotionally — his power grows with chaos, and those who stay technical and control distance can outpoint him. Blood rage makes him powerful but predictable and defensively reckless.

**Image Generation Notes:**
Pixel art portrait: Nightmarish, asymmetric figure — left arm/shoulder noticeably larger than right. Ashen grey-white skin with visible dark veins. Completely hairless, scarred scalp with deliberate patterns. Solid milky-white eyes with pinprick black pupils. Too-wide mouth with filed pointed teeth, grinning. Thick ropy surgical scars across torso. Dark pointed fingernails. Hunched predatory posture. Tattered black cargo pants, barefoot, no shirt. Expression: gleeful malice. Background: pitch black with faint red mist, something moving in the darkness.

### 13. "VENOM" — Cassandra Blake
**Age 28 / Savannah, Georgia, USA / Heel / Seductress-Technician**

**Physical Description:**
- **Height/Weight:** 5'8" / 148 lbs
- **Build:** Athletic hourglass — toned arms, defined core, long legs. The kind of body that gets sponsorship deals. She works hard for it and makes it look effortless.
- **Skin:** Fair, warm peachy undertone, light dusting of freckles across the collarbone
- **Hair:** Honey blonde, thick, usually worn in loose waves past her shoulders. Ties it in a low braid for fights.
- **Eyes:** Green — bright, sharp, predatory. The kind of eyes that make you feel like you've said something wrong.
- **Distinguishing Features:** A small snake tattoo coiling around her left ring finger (where a wedding ring would go). A barely visible scar on her lower lip. Perfect posture — shoulders back, chin up, always.
- **Ring Attire:** Black high-cut leotard with a deep V-back, mesh panels along the sides, black fingerless gloves, black fight boots with a slight heel. Everything fits like it was painted on.
- **Entrance Style:** Slow walk to a sultry blues-rock track, hips rolling, eyes locked on the camera. She doesn't acknowledge the crowd — they're irrelevant. She acknowledges her opponent with a smile that's all teeth.

**Abilities:**
Venom fights with collegiate wrestling and BJJ, using chain wrestling and suffocating top control to grind opponents into submission. Her Southern charm is weaponized — she talks to opponents during clinch breaks, touches them casually, uses her drawl and her body and her "bless your heart" smile to make them feel simultaneously attracted and disrespected. That's what clouds judgment, making opponents slow to defend transitions they'd normally escape. Her chokes are suffocating and psychologically devastating — she whispers during them, and whatever she says, opponents tap faster than the pressure alone explains. Her finishing move, "Kiss of Death," is a rear-naked choke from the back accompanied by whispered words that no one has ever revealed. Her weaknesses are strikers who keep distance and refuse the clinch — if she can't get the fight to the ground, she's hittable. She's a capable but not elite striker at range.

**Image Generation Notes:**
Pixel art portrait: Athletic woman with fair, peachy skin and light freckles across collarbone. Honey blonde hair in loose waves past shoulders. Bright green predatory eyes — the kind that make you feel like you've already lost. Barely visible scar on lower lip. Toned hourglass figure. Black high-cut leotard with deep V-back and mesh side panels, black fingerless gloves, black fight boots — everything painted on, designed to distract. Small snake tattoo on left ring finger. Expression: dangerous smile, all teeth — the Southern femme fatale. Background: dark with muted gold accents, smoke curling.

### 14. "VALKYRIE" — Astrid Eriksson
**Age 31 / Gothenburg, Sweden / Face / Monster-Mystic**

**Physical Description:**
- **Height/Weight:** 6'0" / 190 lbs
- **Build:** Amazonian. Broad shoulders, powerful frame, thick thighs, strong arms. Not lean — built. She towers over most women and many men on the roster. Statuesque, imposing, and undeniably beautiful in a way that makes people stare.
- **Skin:** Fair, very pale, almost porcelain. Flushes red across the cheeks and chest when she exerts herself.
- **Hair:** Platinum blonde (natural), thick, worn in a heavy braid that reaches her mid-back. Loose strands frame her face like a classical painting.
- **Eyes:** Ice blue, intense, deeply set. When her blessing activates, they glow faintly silver.
- **Distinguishing Features:** A network of faint silver-white scars across her knuckles and forearms from years of bare-knuckle training. A Norse rune tattoo (Tiwaz — the warrior rune) on her right collarbone. When she channels her blessing, a faint shimmer appears around her fists that could be sweat catching the light, or something else.
- **Ring Attire:** Steel-grey sports bra with Norse knotwork trim, matching high-cut compression shorts, leather forearm guards, barefoot. Functional, warrior-like, not flashy.
- **Entrance Style:** Norse war drums and a throat-singing chant. She walks out slow and deliberate, each step a statement. Raises both fists to the sky before entering the cage — the crowd roars and the lights flicker silver for a half-second. Could be the lighting. Could be something else.

**Abilities:**
Valkyrie fights with Norse glima wrestling and heavy boxing, augmented by a divine blessing that defies explanation. Her strikes carry supernatural concussive force, and the silver-white aura around her fists absorbs damage beyond what her frame should handle. She's 6'0", 190 lbs of Scandinavian muscle who looks like she walked out of a saga. Opponents second-guess themselves because she's physically imposing and radiates quiet confidence — not mystical awe, just the reality of standing across from the most physically dominant woman on the roster who carries herself like she's already won. Her finishing move, "Chooser of the Slain," is a bodily lift from the clinch into a suspended hold as the divine aura blazes silver, followed by a cage-shaking slam that nobody has gotten up from. Her weaknesses are speed and evasive fighters who won't engage in the clinch, and overuse of her blessing, which leaves her drained — back-to-back fights and long tournaments are dangerous gambles.

**Image Generation Notes:**
Pixel art portrait: Tall, amazonian woman (6'0", 190 lbs) with very fair porcelain skin, thick platinum blonde braid past mid-back. Ice-blue intense eyes. Broad shoulders, powerful build — imposing and beautiful, classical beauty at an intimidating scale. Faint silver-white scars on knuckles/forearms. Norse Tiwaz rune tattoo on right collarbone. Steel-grey sports bra with Norse knotwork trim, matching high-cut shorts, leather forearm guards, barefoot. Faint silver shimmer around fists. Emphasize her sheer physical scale, the way she carries herself like she's already won — she's the most physically imposing woman on the roster and that IS the presence. Expression: calm authority, quiet power. Background: deep steel blue with aurora borealis wisps, Norse rune motifs.

### 15. "BANSHEE" — Sienna Watts
**Age 23 / Manchester, England / Tweener / Wildcard-Survivor**

**Physical Description:**
- **Height/Weight:** 5'4" / 125 lbs
- **Build:** Small, wiry, coiled-spring energy. Not an ounce of fat, all fast-twitch muscle. She looks like she'd break in a stiff wind, and then she kicks someone's head off.
- **Skin:** Fair, pale English complexion with rosy cheeks
- **Hair:** Hot pink buzzcut, grown out just enough to grab (which opponents learn is a mistake — she bites).
- **Eyes:** Hazel, wide, manic. Always moving. She looks like she's daring the world to start something.
- **Distinguishing Features:** Full tattoo sleeves on both arms — chaotic collage of skulls, flowers, cartoon characters, and profanity in ornate script. A nose ring (small silver hoop, left side). A chipped front tooth she refuses to fix. Three earrings in each ear. When she screams, the air around her mouth distorts faintly, like heat haze.
- **Ring Attire:** Neon green sports bra, ripped black denim shorts cut high, taped fists (no gloves when she can get away with it), ratty black Converse high-tops she's fought in since her first underground bout.
- **Entrance Style:** UK grime music at full volume. She sprints out, slides into the cage, bounces off the ropes, and screams at the crowd. No one knows if she's hyping herself up or threatening the front row. Both, probably.

**Abilities:**
Banshee fights with unorthodox switch-stance kickboxing and raw street fighting — headbutts, elbows, trips, whatever works. Her chaos now has a genuine supernatural edge: her scream carries dark arts power that disrupts opponents' focus and induces momentary fear and disorientation. She doesn't understand it and doesn't care. She's the kind of person who makes a room louder just by walking in, who gets in your face and grins, who treats violence like foreplay. She's attractive the way a lit fuse is attractive. Her finishing move, "Wail of the Banshee," combines her supernatural scream with a leaping spinning heel kick — the scream startles opponents just long enough for the kick to connect with sickening force. Her weaknesses are disciplined, methodical fighters who don't engage with her chaos, and cardio — she burns white-hot and fades in later rounds.

**Image Generation Notes:**
Pixel art portrait: Small, wiry woman (5'4") with fair pale skin, rosy cheeks. Hot pink buzzcut. Wide, manic hazel eyes. Nose ring (silver hoop, left side), chipped front tooth, multiple ear piercings. Full chaotic tattoo sleeves on both arms. Neon green sports bra, ripped black denim shorts cut high, taped fists, ratty black Converse high-tops. Pure punk chaos — the pink buzzcut, the feral grin, the chipped tooth, the tattoo sleeves, the ripped denim, the Converse. Already visually compelling without any magic effects. Expression: feral grin, manic energy. Background: neon green and black, graffiti-style splatter effects, UK urban grit.

### 16. "CROWN" — Zara Osei
**Age 26 / Washington D.C., USA (Ghanaian-American) / Heel / Technician-Mystic**

**Physical Description:**
- **Height/Weight:** 5'7" / 155 lbs
- **Build:** Athletic, balanced, functional muscle. Not showy — purposeful. Every muscle exists because it's useful, and she trains with the precision of someone who knows exactly what her body should look like.
- **Skin:** Deep rich brown, flawless
- **Hair:** Natural 4C hair styled in an elaborate crown of braids interwoven with thin gold thread. It takes hours to prepare and she never fights without it.
- **Eyes:** Dark brown, cool, appraising. She looks at opponents the way a chess master looks at a board. Her gaze has an almost tangible weight — opponents describe feeling pinned by it.
- **Distinguishing Features:** Small gold stud earrings (always). A thin gold chain necklace with a single Adinkra symbol pendant (the "Dwennimmen" — strength and humility, though she seems to have skipped the humility part). Elegant hands that seem too refined for fighting.
- **Ring Attire:** White and gold fight shorts, white sports bra with gold trim, white grappling gloves, white fight shoes. Immaculate. If she bleeds on it, she looks annoyed.
- **Entrance Style:** Classical music — Vivaldi. She walks out with perfect posture, gold robe over her shoulders, and removes it like she's doing the world a favor by fighting. Places it neatly in her corner. Adjusts her braids. Nods to the referee. Ready.

**Abilities:**
Crown fights with BJJ and judo, using devastating throws that transition directly into suffocating ground control and methodical submission chains. What she's always believed is pure intellectual analysis is actually latent psychic ability — low-level psychic pattern recognition that lets her read opponents' intentions before they commit. The Adinkra pendant (Dwennimmen) is an ancestral focus that amplifies this unconsciously. She doesn't know any of this yet; she thinks she's simply smarter than everyone else. She picks apart your technique in the press conference, looks at you like a specimen, and fights with such contemptuous precision that you feel like you're being graded. She doesn't seduce — she dominates through intellectual superiority so complete it's demoralizing. Her finishing move, "Magna Cum Laude," is a technically perfect rear-naked choke that removes options until sleep is the only one left. Her weaknesses are chaotic, irrational fighters who confuse her psychic reads, and having no Plan B — when her predictive model breaks, she has never needed a backup.

**Image Generation Notes:**
Pixel art portrait: Athletic woman with deep rich brown flawless skin. Natural 4C hair in elaborate crown of braids interwoven with gold thread — the braids alone are a statement. Cool, appraising dark brown eyes with cutting intellectual intensity. Gold stud earrings, thin gold chain with Adinkra pendant. Balanced athletic build. White and gold fight shorts, white sports bra with gold trim, white grappling gloves, white fight shoes — immaculate. She looks like a queen holding court, not a wizard casting spells. Expression: cold intellectual confidence, cold appraisal, looking down slightly. Background: white and gold, geometric patterns, chess-piece motifs.

### 17. "SUNDANCE" — Riley Callahan
**Age 24 / Boulder, Colorado, USA / Face / Prodigy-Mystic**

**Physical Description:**
- **Height/Weight:** 5'6" / 138 lbs
- **Build:** Compact gymnast's physique — powerful legs, strong core, defined shoulders. Small but explosive. Every movement looks like it has springs loaded.
- **Skin:** Lightly tanned, sun-kissed with a scatter of freckles across her nose and cheekbones.
- **Hair:** Sun-bleached brown with natural golden highlights, worn in a messy high ponytail that whips around during fights. Looks like she just came off a hiking trail.
- **Eyes:** Warm brown, bright, expressive. When she's locked in, they sharpen. When she's having fun, they practically sparkle.
- **Distinguishing Features:** A small sunflower tattoo behind her right ear. Muscular, prominent calves from years of gymnastics. A chipped canine tooth from a training accident that she thinks looks "cool." Perpetual slight sunburn on her nose.
- **Ring Attire:** Burnt orange and white fight shorts, matching sports bra, orange hand wraps, barefoot. Clean, sporty, nothing fancy.
- **Entrance Style:** Indie rock anthem blasting, she jogs out doing backflips down the walkway. No joke — full standing back tucks. The crowd loses their minds. She high-fives fans all the way to the cage. It's impossible not to root for her.

**Abilities:**
Sundance fights with dynamic karate and acrobatic movement, using her gymnastics background to attack from impossible angles that traditional fighters can't predict. A budding elemental connection to light and solar energy makes her faster and more explosive in bright conditions — she's measurably quicker in outdoor venues and under strong lights, though she hasn't fully figured out why. She's genuinely friendly before the bell, high-fives everyone, grins through exchanges, and opponents mistake her warmth for softness right up until she takes their head off with a spinning kick. Her charm is real, not supernatural — that's what makes it effective. Her finishing move, "Sundance," is a feinted spinning kick into a leaping Superman punch from the opposite angle — so unorthodox that even fighters who've studied tape can't time it. Her weaknesses are grapplers who take her down (gymnastics doesn't help on the ground), methodical fighters who won't engage her flow, and diminished performance in dark or indoor venues.

**Image Generation Notes:**
Pixel art portrait: Compact, athletic young woman with lightly tanned sun-kissed skin, freckles across nose and cheeks. Sun-bleached brown hair with golden highlights in messy high ponytail. Warm brown bright eyes, chipped canine tooth visible in grin. Gymnast's build — powerful legs, strong core, explosive. Burnt orange and white fight shorts and matching sports bra, orange hand wraps, barefoot. Small sunflower tattoo behind right ear. She's sun-kissed, not sun-powered — emphasize the freckles, the genuine grin, the messy ponytail, the wholesome athleticism. The girl next door who can do a standing back tuck. Expression: bright, energetic grin — genuine joy. Background: warm orange and gold, mountain silhouette, sunburst.

### 18. "REDBACK" — Talia Cross
**Age 29 / Darwin, Northern Territory, Australia / Tweener / Survivor-Monster**

**Physical Description:**
- **Height/Weight:** 5'10" / 170 lbs
- **Build:** Raw, hard-earned muscle. Not sculpted — forged. Broad back, thick forearms, heavy hands. She looks like she was built for manual labor and then pointed at people.
- **Skin:** Deep tan, sun-weathered, with a permanent farmer's tan line on her biceps. Freckles and sun spots scattered across her shoulders.
- **Hair:** Dirty blonde, sun-bleached almost white at the tips, usually pulled into a rough low bun. Doesn't care what it looks like.
- **Eyes:** Pale grey, flat, assessing. The kind of eyes that make you check if you've locked your car. When her blood rage activates, her pale grey eyes develop red flecks.
- **Distinguishing Features:** A thick scar running from her right temple down past her jaw — she claims it's from a crocodile but won't elaborate. Rough, calloused hands. A faded tattoo of a redback spider on her left hip. Her nose has been broken at least twice and set badly. When her blood rage activates, the veins in her forearms and neck darken visibly.
- **Ring Attire:** Olive green sports bra, khaki-colored fight shorts, taped fists, barefoot. She dresses like she's going to work on a cattle station, not a fight.
- **Entrance Style:** AC/DC. She walks out chewing something (jerky? gum? nobody asks), cracks her neck, climbs into the cage, and leans against the fence until the ref tells her to come to center. Like she's waiting for a bus.

**Abilities:**
Redback fights with catch wrestling and dirty boxing — grinding, painful, old-school submission grappling combined with short, nasty clinch work. A government enhancement program during her "missing years" left her with a dormant blood rage — under enough damage, her pain threshold drops to zero and her strength surges beyond normal human limits. She fights it because activating it means losing control. Her intense, no-nonsense presence has a raw magnetism that draws attention and unsettles opponents. Her finishing move, "Redback Bite," is a brutal neck crank applied from the back — not a choke but a crank, the most painful finish in the league. Opponents tap immediately or risk serious injury. Her weaknesses are strikers who keep distance (she's not fast or dynamic on the feet), and blood rage making her reckless and predictable if triggered.

**Image Generation Notes:**
Pixel art portrait: Tall, raw-muscled woman (5'10") with deep tan sun-weathered skin, freckles/sun spots on shoulders. Dirty blonde sun-bleached hair in rough low bun. Flat pale grey eyes, twice-broken nose. Thick scar from right temple past jaw. Calloused hands. Olive green sports bra, khaki fight shorts, taped fists, barefoot. Faded redback spider tattoo on left hip. Emphasize the weathered physicality — the crocodile scar, the twice-broken nose, the calloused hands, the flat assessing stare. Her image should read as "this woman has survived things you can't imagine." Expression: flat, unreadable, waiting. Background: dusty outback orange-brown, harsh sunlight, heat shimmer.

### 19. "SPECTER" — Katya Novak
**Age 25 / Chicago, Illinois, USA (Czech heritage) / Tweener / Experiment-Survivor**

**Physical Description:**
- **Height/Weight:** 5'8" / 160 lbs
- **Build:** Lean, hard, functional. Like Vesper but rawer — less "designed" and more "survived." Angular shoulders, sinewy arms, a body that looks like it was forged through hardship rather than training.
- **Skin:** Fair, cool-toned, almost translucent in certain light. Faint blue veins visible at the temples and wrists.
- **Hair:** Dark brown, straight, cut to a sharp chin-length bob. Clean and severe. A single streak of premature grey at the left temple.
- **Eyes:** Pale grey, unnervingly still. In certain light — or during intense moments — they flash with a brief static-like distortion, like a screen glitching.
- **Distinguishing Features:** Faint circular scars on both temples, partially hidden by her hair (injection sites). When she overexerts, her hands tremble with a fine micro-tremor. She runs cold — her handshakes are always freezing. A small tattoo of a moth on the inside of her left wrist (she doesn't remember getting it). Her stillness has a magnetic, unsettling beauty — people stare without knowing why.
- **Ring Attire:** Plain black sports bra, plain black compression shorts, black hand wraps, barefoot. No branding, no flair. She looks like she's at a sparring session, not a fight night.
- **Entrance Style:** No music. She walks out in silence, hands at her sides, looking straight ahead. The crowd doesn't know whether to cheer or be disturbed. Most settle on uneasy quiet. She doesn't seem to notice.

**Abilities:**
Specter fights with mechanically precise kickboxing and instinctive combat sambo — as the second Project Zarya subject, her reflexes and pattern recognition are enhanced beyond normal human limits. Her psychic ability manifests as precognitive flashes — she reacts to strikes before they're thrown, slipping and returning fire with unsettling timing that looks more programmed than practiced. An eerie, haunting quality to her stillness draws attention in unsettling ways, a quiet magnetism that opponents can't quite shake. Her finishing move, "Flatline," is a sudden straight right thrown with her entire body behind it at the exact moment of maximum vulnerability — no wind-up, no tell, opponents describe a flash of static in their vision right before it lands. Her weaknesses are chaotic fighters who don't follow patterns (her enhanced reflexes counter technique, not madness), extended fights that cause overheating (nosebleeds, tremors), and an inconsistent finishing instinct that occasionally just doesn't activate.

**Image Generation Notes:**
Pixel art portrait: Lean, angular woman with fair cool-toned almost translucent skin, visible blue veins at temples/wrists. Dark brown sharp chin-length bob with a grey streak at left temple — the contrast between her youth and the premature grey is unsettling. Pale grey unnervingly still eyes with faint static distortion. Faint circular scars on both temples. Plain black sports bra, plain black compression shorts, black hand wraps, barefoot. Small moth tattoo on inside of left wrist. Emphasize her severe bob, her unnervingly still expression — she should look like someone you'd stare at on a train and then feel unsettled for doing it. Expression: blank, watchful, magnetic and unsettling. Background: dark grey with static/signal interference effects, glitch artifacts.

### 20. "APEX" — Morgan Reid
**Age 27 / Houston, Texas, USA / Face / Technician-Mystic**

**Physical Description:**
- **Height/Weight:** 5'9" / 165 lbs
- **Build:** Functional, well-rounded, nothing overdeveloped. The body of someone who trains everything and poses for nothing. Strong without being showy, athletic without being flashy. The kind of build that coaches point to and say "that's what a fighter should look like."
- **Skin:** Fair with warm undertone, light freckles across the bridge of her nose
- **Hair:** Dark auburn, thick, always in a tight practical braid. No product, no styling.
- **Eyes:** Hazel — green in some light, brown in others. Steady, focused, direct. She looks at people like she's actually listening, which is rarer than it should be.
- **Distinguishing Features:** No tattoos. No piercings. No scars worth noting. In a league of monsters, mystics, and experiments, Morgan Reid looks aggressively normal. Coaches have always said there's something about her — she hits harder than she should, recovers faster than expected, and no one can explain it.
- **Ring Attire:** Navy blue and white fight shorts, matching sports bra, blue hand wraps, plain white fight shoes. Clean, functional, unbranded. She's turned down three sponsorship deals because she didn't like the logos.
- **Entrance Style:** A Texas country rock anthem. She walks out focused, shadowboxing lightly, making eye contact with her corner. No showboating. She taps gloves with her opponent and means it. The crowd respects her. It's not love yet — she hasn't given them a reason to scream. But they watch.

**Abilities:**
Apex fights with pure MMA — genuinely well-rounded, competent everywhere, no glaring weaknesses. What she doesn't know: her consistency and late-fight surges are powered by latent chi mastery, a natural energy she's been unconsciously channeling since childhood. Her strikes hit harder than her frame suggests, her endurance has no clear ceiling, and her recovery defies her training volume. Her approachable, steady confidence has a quiet magnetism — the girl-next-door who could beat you up, drawing people in without trying. Her finishing move, "Apex Predator," is a controlled late-fight output surge where she increases volume by 50%, going from metronome to storm with relentless, terrifying intensity. Her weaknesses are that her chi is unconscious, so she can't control or maximize it; she has no flashy weapons against true supernatural fighters; and her ceiling remains unknown — she might simply not have enough when facing someone who's literally more than human.

**Image Generation Notes:**
Pixel art portrait: Athletic, well-proportioned woman with fair warm-toned skin, light freckles on nose. Dark auburn hair in tight practical braid. Steady hazel eyes. No tattoos, no piercings, no scars — aggressively normal in a world of freaks. Functional build, not flashy. Navy blue and white fight shorts and matching sports bra, blue hand wraps, white fight shoes. No effects, no magic, no gimmicks. She's compelling because she's the only normal person in a room full of freaks. Expression: calm, focused, determined — a professional at work. Background: clean navy blue and white, minimal effects, good lighting.
