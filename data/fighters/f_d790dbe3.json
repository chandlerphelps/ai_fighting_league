  "ring_name": "MANBO",
  "real_name": "Marie-Ange Saint-Fleur",
  "age": "27",
  "origin": "Port-au-Prince, Haiti",
  "alignment": "heel",
  "gender": "female",
  "height": "5'6\"",
  "weight": "134",
  "build": "Slender with long limbs and deceptive strength - looks delicate as a heron but moves with predatory grace. Hip-heavy proportions suggest fertility and power in Vodou tradition.",
  "distinguishing_features": "Three raised scarification lines on each cheek (traditional marks of a manbo initiate), small blue beads woven into her tightly braided hair in a geometric pattern, a faded burn scar on her left palm from a 'failed' ritual as a child, unnervingly clear white eyes that seem to see beyond physical reality, always painted lips in shades of indigo or crimson depending on her mood.",
  "ring_attire": "Begins matches in flowing white ceremonial robes embroidered with black Vodou veve symbols (sacred geometric patterns), wearing them open to reveal a black leather fighting harness with small pouches containing her 'spiritual tools' - salt, candles, bones. Beneath: high-cut black leather shorts with white beadwork along the edges. Fights barefoot, her feet blackened with ritual chalk. Heavy gold jewelry - thick cuffs on both wrists, multiple chain necklaces with various pendants (skulls, hands, eyes), large circular earrings that frame her face. Before fights, she anoints her forehead with scented oil and lights small candles in her corner, creating smoke that she waves toward opponents.",
  "backstory": "Born in the slums of Port-au-Prince to a family of houngan (Vodou priests), Marie-Ange was raised in the spiritual traditions of Haitian Vodou. By twelve, she was already showing 'the sight' - an uncanny ability to read opponents' fears and weaknesses. Her grandmother, a renowned manbo, trained her in the old ways: possession rituals, herbal medicine, the art of 'feeding' spirits through sacrifice. At sixteen, during a possession ceremony, Marie-Ange collapsed mid-trance - the spirits refused to speak to her. Her grandmother declared her 'hollow' - one without spiritual protection. Shunned by her community, she was cast out to the streets where she discovered that while she couldn't access the supernatural, she could weaponize the perception of it. She spent years studying theatrical technique, misdirection, and psychological manipulation. Now she fights as a 'false prophet' - performing rituals she knows are empty, calling on spirits she knows don't answer, all while genuinely believing her hollow nature is a curse she can fight through victory. Each opponent she defeats, she believes, brings her closer to spiritual wholeness.",
  "personality_traits": [
    "Theatrical and dramatic - every action is performance",
    "Ruthlessly pragmatic beneath mystical facade",
    "Genuinely believes in spirituality despite her 'hollow' nature",
    "Uses opponents' superstitions against them"
  ],
  "fears_quirks": [
    "Deep fear that her spiritual emptiness is permanent and unforgivable",
    "Performs a small ritual before every match - washing her hands in saltwater, humming - that she never skips"
  ],
  "fighting_style": {
    "primary_style": "Capoeira (with focus on psychological disruption through the ginga rhythm)",
    "secondary_style": "Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu (guard-focused, submission heavy)",
    "signature_move": "The Greeting (Salire): She breaks fighting distance to perform an exaggerated Capoeira ginga, bowing and swinging her arms in patterns that resemble Vodou invocation. While opponents watch, confused, she reads their body language, identifies their tension patterns, and strikes the moment they relax - often a devastating kick to the lead leg as they drop their guard.",
    "finishing_move": "The Hollow Throne (Tron\u7fc1 Venn): A guard pull that looks like she's 'surrendering' to the mat. When opponents follow her down, she wraps them in guard using a bizarre leg-scorpion transition that appears impossible, then applies a triangle choke while whispering Creole prayers loud enough for crowds to hear. She holds the finish until opponents pass out or tap, never releasing early - 'spirits demand sacrifice.'",
    "known_weaknesses": [
      "Over-relies on psychological games - struggles against opponents who ignore her theatrics",
      "Genuinely believes in her spiritual powers, making her vulnerable to anyone who can break that illusion"
