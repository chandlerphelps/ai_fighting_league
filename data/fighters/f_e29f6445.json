  "id": "f_e29f6445",
  "ring_name": "ZAVOD",
  "real_name": "Milena Stojanovi\u0107",
  "age": 38,
  "origin": "Belgrade, Serbia",
  "alignment": "tweener",
  "gender": "female",
  "height": "5'6\"",
  "weight": "142 lbs",
  "build": "Compact and densely muscular - not tall but built like a safe, every inch earned through decades of combat. Wide shoulders and thick neck from Sanda training, but lean hips and runner's legs. Looks younger than her age until she removes her top and reveals a torso mapped with old trauma.",
  "distinguishing_features": "Three parallel scar lines across her left ribs from a knife fight at nineteen, small circular burn scar on right shoulder from a cigarette (self-inflicted, to stay awake during a interrogation), slightly cauliflower ears from Sanda clinch work, deep lines around eyes from squinting through too many fights. Hair kept short and practical - dirty blonde with early gray at the temples she doesn't bother hiding.",
  "ring_attire": "Wears an unzipped gray tactical hoodie over a black sports bra, the hoodie deliberately oversized to hide her frame from opponents who try to game-plan her physique. Below: black compression leggings with side pockets, worn black MMA gloves she's had since her first professional fight - they're soft as cloth from years of use and she refuses to replace them. Fights in simple black slip-on shoes. A thin silver chain around her neck with a small Orthodox cross - she wears it but never discusses religion. Before fights, she methodically wraps her own hands while staring at nothing, a ritual opponents have learned not to interrupt.",
  "backstory": "Milena grew up in New Belgrade during the worst years - not the bombs, but the after. Her father disappeared when she was eight, her mother worked three jobs that paid in bread and cigarettes, and by twelve she was running packages for men who never told her their names. She learned to fight not in a gym but in the stairwells of concrete apartment blocks, defending her mother's honor and her own survival with a fury that surprised grown men. By sixteen, she was boxing in underground pits for money that kept the electricity on. A Sanda coach discovered her at nineteen, saw something in her violence - the precision beneath the rage - and took her to Budapest where she became Milena Stojanovi\u0107, professional fighter. She won two European titles, had a brief and unsuccessful run in the UFC, and then the injuries began. Three knee surgeries, a broken jaw, a detached retina. Her body quit on her before her mind did. Now at thirty-eight, she fights not for glory but because she no longer knows how to be anything else. She respects the sport's younger stars but refuses to idolize them - she remembers when they were in diapers. Her motivation is simple: the day she stops fighting is the day she has to confront everything she became to survive, and she's not ready for that conversation.",
  "personality_traits": [
    "Pragmatic to the point of brutality - she doesn't care about style points, only winning",
    "Dry wit delivered in deadpan monotone - her jokes sound like threats",
    "Deeply private - reveals almost nothing about her past or feelings",
    "Mentor-like with young fighters but refuses to take credit for anything"
  ],
  "fears_quirks": [
    "Terrified of becoming irrelevant - she trains harder than anyone half her age to prove she still belongs",
    "Compulsive hand-wrapping ritual before fights - if interrupted, she becomes visibly agitated",
    "Keeps a photo of her mother in her gym bag but will never show it to anyone"
  ],
  "fighting_style": {
    "primary_style": "Sanda (Sanshou) - kickboxing base with knee strikes, elbows, and explosive clinch work",
    "secondary_style": "Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu - defensive guard work, submission specialist when fights go to ground",
    "signature_move": "The Accounting - a knee strike from the clinch followed by an elbow if the opponent drops, named because 'everyone eventually pays what they owe'",
    "finishing_move": "The Bailout - rear naked choke applied from front headlock position, named for the extraction helicopters she saw as a child",
    "known_weaknesses": [
      "Declining cardio - can't maintain pace beyond two rounds at full intensity",
      "Right knee is surgically repaired and vulnerable to leg kicks",
      "Hasn't fought top-tier competition in five years and may be physically outmatched by elite younger athletes"
