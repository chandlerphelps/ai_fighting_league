  "ring_name": "BABY ZEPHYR",
  "real_name": "Dmitri Yevgeni Volkov",
  "age": 31,
  "origin": "Saint Petersburg, Russia",
  "alignment": "tweener",
  "gender": "male",
  "height": "6'2\"",
  "weight": "285 lbs",
  "build": "Bear-like bulk - thick through the chest and torso with a pronounced middle, arms like tree trunks covered in soft-looking fair hair, massive hands with thick fingers, legs that are powerful but not chiseled - he carries his weight like a draft horse, all functional strength no aesthetics",
  "distinguishing_features": "Full beard grown since his circus days, keeps it groomed but wild, small gold front teeth visible when he smiles, old stretch marks across his belly from rapid weight changes, a faded tattoo of a laughing clown on his inner left forearm he refuses to explain, slight eastward turn in his left eye from an old fight, perpetual sunburned nose",
  "ring_attire": "Wears loose flannel shirts unbuttoned over compression shorts before matches - the shirt is part of his act, frequently lifted to display his belly to crowds and opponents alike. Fights in simple black board shorts with a small Russian flag pin on the waistband he removed from a military jacket. Sometimes wears a worn leather harness with metal rings - circus aesthetic he refuses to abandon. Barefoot in the ring, he claims shoes 'confuse his balance,' fights with socks pulled up to his calves like an old man. A small stuffed toy hangs from his corner - a faded pink elephant named Pyotr he carried in his first circus act.",
  "backstory": "Dmitri was a circus strongman from age 16 - not the headliner but the reliable utility player who lifted props, held horses, and occasionally posed with the bearded lady. He could deadlift 500 pounds before he could legally drink. When the circus disbanded after a bankrupt owner skipped town, Dmitri found himself in underground fight clubs where his strength meant nothing against experienced technique. He lost his first seventeen fights. But he kept coming back, and trainers noticed something: he never stayed hurt, never stayed down, and somehow always made his opponents tired just by existing near them. He learned to fight not by training but by surviving - by letting others exhaust themselves against his mass. Now he headlines events not because he's skilled but because he breaks people simply by being impossible to put away. He treats fighting like his old circus acts: performance first, victory second, though he's discovered he quite likes winning.",

    "Afraid of small enclosed spaces since being locked in a circus wagon for three days during a protest",

  ],
  "fighting_style": {
    "primary_style": "Sambo - uses his weight and flexibility for devastating clinch work and ground grappling",
    "secondary_style": "Brawler base - basic boxing learned from underground fights, relies on jab-cross combinations to close distance",
    "signature_move": "The Tent Pole: Catches opponent's punch, uses momentum to spin them into a suplex, lands on top with full body weight - crowd favorite that rarely ends fights but always gets reactions",
    "finishing_move": "The Final Bow: Catches opponent in a front headlock, drops to his knees driving them face-first into the mat while he extends his arms wide like a performer accepting applause",
    "known_weaknesses": [
      "Terrible cardio - gasses if fights go past second round",
      "No fight IQ to speak of - completely predictable once opponents realize he's a one-round fighter",
      "Easily distracted by crowd reactions, will pause mid-fight to acknowledge cheering"
