  "real_name": "Elena Marchetti",
  "age": 28,
  "origin": "Melbourne, Victoria, Australia",
  "alignment": "tweener",
  "gender": "female",
  "height": "5'7\"",
  "weight": "135 lbs",
  "build": "Lean andathletic with a swimmer's build - long limbs, narrow waist, broad shoulders, visible lean muscle from years of precise drilling rather than heavy lifting. Looks like she could be a competitive fencer or archer rather than a fighter.",
  "distinguishing_features": "A thin white scar running diagonally across her left cheek from a training accident in her teens. Multiple small calluses on her knuckles and fingertips from countless hours of pad work and weapon training. She keeps her auburn hair in a tight practical ponytail that never loosens. Slight asymmetry in her shoulders - left slightly higher from a developmental imbalance she never corrected. Cold gray-green eyes that assess everything with surgical precision.",
  "ring_attire": "Fights in a cropped black compression top with high armholes, the fabric so thin it's nearly sheer, displaying a black sports bra beneath. High-waisted black cycling shorts with silver reflective strips running down the sides - she chose them for visibility, not aesthetics. Fingerless gloves in worn black leather, the padding worn completely flat from years of use - she refuses to replace them because 'new gloves change the feel.' On her feet: simple black slip-on training shoes with minimal sole. A thin silver chain around her left bicep - her mother's wedding ring on a chain she wears to every fight. Before entering, she always adjusts her ponytail three times in exactly the same manner.",
  "backstory": "Elena Marchetti was born in Melbourne to Italian immigrant parents who ran a small fencing studio in the city's inner suburbs. She was practically raised on the strip, learning foil technique before she could read, competing in junior competitions by eight. But Elena was never content with just fencing - she watched her father's old martial arts videos obsessively, teaching herself Wing Chun from pirated tapes while her peers were learning algebra. By sixteen, she'd crossed paths with a retired Australian military close-combat instructor who recognized something in her: not raw talent, but obsessive precision. He taught her Systema principles - breath control, tension management, using an opponent's force against them - and Elena found her calling. She competed in amateur boxing and Muay Thai simultaneously, never to prove she was the best, but to prove her system was perfect. Her record is methodical: she doesn't knock people out, she solves them. Every fight is an engineering problem. She views the AI Fighting League as the ultimate test - a proving ground for her methodology against the world's most dangerous competitors.",

  "fears_quirks": [
    "Cannot tolerate chaos or unpredictability - it genuinely unsettles her",
    "Must have her pre-fight routine exactly the same every time or she becomes visibly anxious"
  ],
  "fighting_style": {
    "primary_style": "Wing Chun - focuses on centerline theory, close-range trapping, and simultaneous attack/defense. She uses her lead hand as a sensor to read opponents while her rear hand delivers precise power strikes.",
    "secondary_style": "Systema (Russian martial art) - emphasizes breathing to manage tension, using an opponent's force against them, and staying relaxed under pressure. She never meets force with force.",
    "signature_move": "The Calibration - she traps both of an opponent's arms in her Wing Chun pak sao (wing hand) position, using their own momentum to spin them 180 degrees while delivering a knee strike to their spine. Named because she 'recalibrates' their orientation.",
    "finishing_move": "The Verification - a precise three-strike combination: simultaneous palm strike to the sternum (checks their structure), elbow strike to the floating ribs (breaks their breathing), and a final palm heel to the chin (snaps their head back). She developed it to score clean without excessive violence, but it's devastatingly effective.",
    "known_weaknesses": [
      "Lacks knockout power - relies on accumulation rather than single finishing blows",
      "Struggles against aggressive pressure fighters who don't give her time to analyze"
