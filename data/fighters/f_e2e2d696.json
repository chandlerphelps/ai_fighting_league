  "ring_name": "RENSEIGNEMENT",
  "real_name": "C\u00e9leste Marchetti",
  "age": 28,
  "origin": "Lyon, Auvergne-Rh\u00f4ne-Alpes, France",
  "alignment": "tweener",
  "gender": "female",
  "height": "5'7\"",
  "weight": "134 lbs",
  "build": "Lean and wiry with a swimmer's build - long limbs, narrow waist, broad shoulders, no bulk but dense lean muscle built through years of precise movement drills rather than heavy lifting. Looks like she could be a fencer or competitive swimmer.",
  "distinguishing_features": "A small beauty mark above her left eyebrow (her signature feature), pale blue eyes that seem to calculate everything, a thin scar on her right forearm from a fencing accident in her youth, no tattoos - she considers body modification 'permanent noise that interferes with analysis.' Hair kept in a severe low bun that never loosens, the same style since her competitive fencing days.",
  "ring_attire": "Clean white tailored shirt with French cuffs, the sleeves rolled precisely to her elbows - she keeps it on throughout fights, refusing the theatrical removal other fighters perform. Beneath: black high-waisted compression shorts with white pinstripes, giving a vintage boxing photograph aesthetic. Fights in pristine white leather boxing shoes with French flag laces - she polishes them before every match. White fingerless gloves with subtle gray palm padding, worn soft from use but immaculately maintained. A thin silver chain around her neck with a small key pendant - the only personal item she wears, origin unexplained.",
  "backstory": "C\u00e9leste was a competitive \u00e9p\u00e9e fencer in the French national circuit, ranking third in Europe before a career-ending knee injury at twenty-two. The injury healed, but her coaches noticed something: she had spent years studying opponents' movements, timing, and tendencies to compensate for her lack of elite physical gifts. She had been analyzing fights, not just competing in them. A sports psychologist recognized her gift for pattern recognition and tactical analysis, connecting her with a retired Savate champion who saw her fencing footwork as a foundation for the French kickboxing style. She trained for four years in relative obscurity, developing a hyper-technical style that prioritizes distance management and point-scoring efficiency over spectacle. She fights because she proved everyone wrong once, and she refuses to let them forget it.",
  "personality_traits": [
    "Analytical - she processes fight footage constantly, memorizing opponent tendencies",
    "Contemptuous of brute force - she considers strength a substitute for skill",
    "Coldly confident - she speaks about opponents as if they've already lost",
    "Perfectionist - becomes visibly irritated by her own minor mistakes"
  ],
  "fears_quirks": [
    "Fear of losing to someone she considers technically inferior - it would invalidate her entire philosophy",
    "Has a habit of touching her key pendant before every attack, a superstitious ritual she denies performing"
  ],
  "fighting_style": {
    "primary_style": "Savate (French boxing) - emphasis on precision kicking at long range, using her fencing footwork to maintain perfect distance",
    "secondary_style": "Boxing - classical French boxing technique, sharp jab-cross combinations to set up kicks",
    "signature_move": "The Dossier - a systematic combination: jab to measure distance, low crescent kick to check footwork, then a high fouett\u00e9 kick to the head once she identifies her opponent's defensive pattern. She only uses it after 'filing' her opponent's tendencies.",
    "finishing_move": "Classification Finale - a perfectly timed counter: she leans back from an incoming attack (her exceptional distance perception), simultaneously delivering a devastating uppercut while her opponent is committed to the strike, followed by a crushing head kick to the fallen opponent.",
    "known_weaknesses": [
      "Struggles against aggressive pressure fighters who ignore her distance game",
      "Poor clinch work - prefers to keep opponents at striking range",
      "Can be baited into exchanges by opponents who fake patterns"
