  "ring_name": "BANYAN",
  "real_name": "Amira Okonkwo",
  "age": 27,
  "origin": "Lagos, Nigeria",
  "alignment": "tweener",
  "gender": "female",
  "height": "5'8\"",
  "weight": "142 lbs",
  "build": "Athletic and well-proportioned with visible lean muscle - not bulky but dense and functional. Wide hips and strong thighs from years of running and climbing. Broad shoulders that hint at surprising upper body strength. Her frame suggests endurance over explosive power.",
  "distinguishing_features": "Dark brown skin with a series of thin white scarification lines running parallel along her forearms (traditional Igbo markings from her mother), a small crescent scar above her left eyebrow from a childhood accident, always keeps her hair in tight braided cornrows with small wooden beads at the ends. Her eyes are warm brown but hold a perpetually assessing quality - she unconsciously maps exits and threats in any room she enters.",
  "ring_attire": "Fights in olive green cargo shorts with multiple pockets (a nod to her past), paired with a matching sports bra cropped just below her ribs. Wears fingerless training gloves in worn brown leather, the left glove slightly thicker to compensate for an old injury to her pinky finger. On her feet: simple black slip-on shoes with rubber soles - she refuses to wear anything she can't escape from quickly. A worn cloth bracelet on her right wrist - the only personal item she kept from her old life. Sometimes wears a thin mesh tank top over the bra in cooler arenas, but removes it early in fights.",
  "backstory": "Amira grew up in a wealthy Lagos family until her father's business dealings with the wrong people turned their lives upside down. At fourteen, she was kidnapped along with her younger brother and held for ransom in the Niger Delta. Her brother didn't survive. She did - through a combination of quiet observation, patience, and one desperate night when she talked a young guard into helping her escape. She spent the next five years moving between cities, working odd jobs, learning to fight from street kids and gym rats who became her family. She discovered MMA almost by accident at twenty, entering an underground tournament in Port Harcourt with nothing but survival instincts and something to prove. She won. Now she fights not for glory but because the ring is the only place where her past doesn't follow her - where the only thing that matters is whether she can endure.",

    "primary_style": "Wrestling (freestyle/Greco-Roman)",
    "secondary_style": "Dirty boxing and clinch work",
    "signature_move": "The Undertow - From the clinch, she sweeps her opponent's lead leg while hooking their neck, taking them down sideways and immediately transitioning to half-guard. Named for the way it drags opponents into her world.",
    "finishing_move": "The Inheritance - A rear naked choke applied from back control, but she threads her forearm under the chin and uses her legs to trap one of the opponent's arms, making it nearly impossible to escape. Named because she learned it from a man who beat her repeatedly before teaching her to beat him.",
    "known_weaknesses": [
      "Poor striker - outclassed on the feet against technical boxers/kickboxers",
      "Has a habit of engaging in brawls when her composure breaks, taking unnecessary punishment"

    "BANYAN's first professional victory came via submission\u2014a calculated dismantling that proved his preparation outmatched TALON's fury. But even in triumph, the hypervigilant warrior couldn't shake the feeling that he'd revealed too much, too soon. The self-deprecating humor he weaponized post-fight masked a darker truth: he'd tasted blood, and part of him craved the next fight already."
