  "real_name": "Park Ji-yeon",
  "age": 26,
  "origin": "Seoul, South Korea",
  "alignment": "heel",
  "gender": "female",
  "height": "5'6\"",
  "weight": "118 lbs",
  "build": "Slender and lithe with dancer's proportions - long limbs, narrow waist, toned legs, graceful posture. Appears delicate but moves with coiled precision.",
  "distinguishing_features": "Ink-black hair often styled in elaborate updos with silver pins shaped like cherry blossoms. Small silver hoop in her left nostril. No visible scars or tattoos - she considers her unmarked skin her greatest asset. Eyes are heavily lined with dark makeup that makes her gaze feel magnetic.",
  "ring_attire": "High-cut black latex leotard with holographic silver panels that catch light like fish scales, cut high on thighs to display long legs. Sheer black mesh crop top with silver geometric patterns over the leotard. Fingerless gloves with silver knuckle guards. Knee-high platform boots with silver heels - she fights in them not despite the height disadvantage but because she enjoys making opponents look down on her. A thin silver chain belt with small bells that chime when she moves, driving opponents crazy trying to track her.",
  "backstory": "Ji-yeon was born the daughter of a traditional pansori singer and a taekwondo master - two worlds that rarely intersected in conservative Seoul. She chose dance, training in contemporary and traditional Korean dance at the Seoul Arts Academy until a career-ending ankle injury at nineteen. Broke and directionless, she fell in with an underground fight circuit run by a former K-1 champion who saw something others didn't: she moved like no fighter he'd ever trained, her dancer's body capable of making opponents miss while she landed precision strikes. She fought her first professional match at twenty-one, losing badly but learning she could make men do stupid things just by existing near them. Now she weaponizes every gaze, every slow breath, every whispered taunt. She doesn't just want to win - she wants opponents to remember her for the rest of their lives, to question why they lost to someone so beautiful.",

  "fears_quirks": [
    "She is terrified of becoming invisible, of being forgotten",

  "fighting_style": {
    "primary_style": "Hybrid kickboxing with dance-influenced movement",
    "secondary_style": "Dirty boxing and clinch work",
    "signature_move": "The Silence Drop - She presses a single finger to her lips, waiting for opponents to follow the gesture, then uses their momentary distraction to launch a spinning back kick to the head.",
    "finishing_move": "Crescent Moon - A prolonged psychological assault during ground control. She mounts opponent, slows her pace deliberately, adjusts her hair, makes eye contact with the crowd, then lands brutal short elbows while whispering insults only they can hear. She doesn't rush to finish - she makes them feel every second of helplessness.",
    "known_weaknesses": [
      "Poor strength relative to size - cannot muscle out of bad positions",
      "Endurance issues if fight goes past third round - her pace-based style demands explosive energy she doesn't have late"
