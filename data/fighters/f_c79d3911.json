He was born with abnormal muscular density\u2014a genetic gift that made him built differently than normal men. When his younger sister was killed in a gang dispute, Viktor waited for the killers at a warehouse and beat three men to death with his bare hands. He served twelve years in a Ukrainian prison, where he became a legend in underground fighting pits, earning his nickname from the way he drowned opponents in his crushing embrace. Released at thirty, he now fights in the AI League to earn enough money to leave the country\u2014the criminal organizations that control Odessa want him dead, and his only escape is to become valuable enough to be untouchable.",

    "The Kraken sinks another vessel. Round 2 destruction of MALAPERTE sends a message: this machine doesn't waste time\u2014he methodically breaks opponents when he chooses to, not when they're ready. Each knockout adds another link to the legend he's forging, a quiet testament to those who underestimate what cold, calculated violence looks like when it has something to protect."
