  "real_name": "Isadora Reis Drummond",
  "age": 27,
  "origin": "Rio de Janeiro, Brazil",
  "alignment": "heel",
  "gender": "female",
  "height": "5'7\"",
  "weight": "134 lbs",
  "build": "Hourglass figure with deceptive softness - appears fragile and elegant but conceals lean dancer's muscle beneath porcelain skin. Long legs, narrow waist, graceful neck. She moves like water, every gesture deliberate and flowing.",
  "distinguishing_features": "Ink-black hair worn in elaborate braided updos held with golden pins shaped like spiderwebs. Skin impossibly smooth and unblemined - she maintains it obsessively. A small black widow spider tattoo (real, not ink - chemically induced) crawling at her left temple. Cat-like green eyes always half-lidded, giving a perpetually sleepy appearance. No scars - she cannot accept any imperfection on her body.",
  "ring_attire": "Black silk cropped jacket with wide sleeves that she slowly removes before fights, draping it over the nearest object or opponent's corner. Beneath: a black lace balconette bra and high-waisted bikini bottoms with golden web patterns. Fishnet stockings with golden seams running up the back of her long legs. Stiletto heels she can actually fight in - four inches of razor-thin golden stiletto. Golden chains around her waist that chime softly when she moves. She fights barefoot when permitted, claiming the floor 'feels more honest.'",
  "backstory": "Isadora was born into Rio's most prestigious circus family - the Drummonds, performers for four generations. She was trained as an aerialist and contortionist from birth, performing with her parents in the famous Circo Drummond until she was 16. A career-ending spinal injury forced her retirement from the big top, but it also freed her to discover her true calling. She spent two years in S\u00e3o Paulo's underground fight scene, learning that her greatest weapon wasn't her flexibility or beauty - it was her ability to make opponents see what they wanted to see. She studied capoeira not for combat but for its hypnotic rhythm, and Brazilian jiu-jitsu from a former Olympic judoka who became her first victim and later her trainer. Her ring name means 'Black Widow' - she spins webs of false vulnerability, lets opponents believe they've caught prey, then wraps them in their own desire. She fights to prove that beauty is not weakness, that the spider is more dangerous than the fly.",

    "Fear of becoming invisible/irrelevant",

  "fighting_style": {
    "primary_style": "Capoeira (with focus on the ginga rhythm as psychological weapon)",
    "secondary_style": "Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu (guard-focused,Submission heavy)",
    "signature_move": "GINGA DA SEDU\u00c7\u00c3O - She begins each fight with an extended display of the capoeira ginga, a hypnotic swaying that looks like a sensual dance. Opponents become entranced, lowering their guard. She uses this to close distance and set up takedowns. The movement is so beautiful that referees and audiences alike have been caught off-guard when she suddenly attacks.",
    "finishing_move": "TEIA DE ARANHA - From guard or half-guard, she wraps her legs in a spider-like triangle while her arms control one arm. She squeezes slowly, cutting circulation, while leaning back and making eye contact with the opponent's corner, smiling. She doesn't crank the submission - she waits for the tap while whispering compliments and insults in Portuguese. The opponent taps, she releases slowly, kisses their forehead, and walks away.",
    "known_weaknesses": [
      "Struggles against opponents who ignore her psychological games and just brawl",
      "Lower durability than most - cannot absorb heavy strikes",
      "Requires crowd attention to perform at peak - fights better with spectators"
