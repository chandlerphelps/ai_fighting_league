  "ring_name": "MALAPERTE",
  "real_name": "Dimitris 'Dimi' Anastakis",
  "age": 26,
  "origin": "Athens, Greece",
  "alignment": "tweener",
  "gender": "male",
  "height": "5'11",
  "weight": "168",
  "build": "Lean and wiry with a swimmer's build - broad shoulders and narrow hips, no bulk, every muscle long and ropey. Looks more like a dance student than a fighter. Appears slightly underdressed for his weight class.",
  "distinguishing_features": "Completely unmarked skin - no scars, tattoos, or blemises. Constant slight smirk that never reaches his eyes. Moves with an uncanny fluidity, as if his joints bend slightly more than they should. Small gold tooth visible when he laughs. Always seems to be looking at something just past whoever he's talking to.",
  "ring_attire": "Wears an unbuttoned white linen shirt over nothing, the fabric billowing behind him like a cape - he never keeps it on long, typically shedding it within the first thirty seconds of a fight. Beneath: black tactical pants with an unnatural number of pockets, each one potentially containing something. Fights in worn white leather loafers with no socks - he considers shoes 'honest.' A silver watch on his left wrist that he never removes, even in combat - an old habit from his con artist days. Sometimes wears a cheap pair of sunglasses perched on his head that he 'borrows' from fans before matches.",
  "backstory": "Dimitris grew up in the immigrant working neighborhoods of Athens, the son of a Romanian mother and Greek father who both disappeared by the time he was twelve. He survived by becoming a small-time con artist, running card games, pickpocketing tourists, and eventually graduated to high-stakes gambling rings where he learned to read people better than any book could teach. Somewhere along the way, he discovered he could fight - not because he'd trained, but because he'd been in so many bar brawls and street scams gone wrong that his body simply... adapted. He fights the same way he scams: unpredictable, always one step ahead, making his opponent question what's real. He entered the AI Fighting League after winning an underground tournament in Piraeus where he defeated three consecutive opponents without throwing a single punch - only dodges, clinches, and psychological manipulation. He calls himself 'Malaperte' - the Greek word for 'misfortune' - because that's what he is to anyone who bets against him.",

    "Has an irrational fear of being trapped in small spaces - even elevators make him anxious",

  "fighting_style": {
    "primary_style": "Capoeira-influenced movement (but unorthodox - he learned from videos, not training)",
    "secondary_style": "Imprecise but effective boxing learned from street fights",
    "signature_move": "The Confidence Trick: He freezes mid-fight, stares at his opponent, and begins giving them detailed advice on how to beat him. While they're confused, he attacks.",
    "finishing_move": "The Bad Beat: A sudden explosion of speed combining a capoeira crescent kick into a standing guillotine, usually applied when opponents think he's just playing around.",
    "known_weaknesses": [
      "Poor grappling defense - if taken down, he's mediocre on the ground",
      "Low durability - hits land hard on him",
      "Ego sometimes causes him to toy with dangerous opponents too long"
