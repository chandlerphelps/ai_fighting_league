  "real_name": "Mateo Delgado-Young",
  "age": "19",
  "origin": "Tijuana, Baja California, Mexico",
  "alignment": "face",
  "gender": "male",
  "height": "5'9\"",
  "weight": "165",
  "build": "Slender but whipcord lean, wiry musculature, every line of his frame suggests explosive speed and fluid movement rather than raw power",
  "distinguishing_features": "Bright monarch butterfly wing tattoos spreading across both shoulder blades in traditional Mexican blackwork style, small scar through left eyebrow from childhood accident, always seems to be moving even when standing still",
  "ring_attire": "Black compression shorts with iridescent blue-green butterfly wing patterns that shimmer under arena lights, matching fingerless gloves, black high-top sneakers with neon green accents, thin gold chain with small monarch butterfly pendant hidden under his chest",
  "backstory": "Mateo was raised in the border chaos of Tijuana, the son of a Mexican-American mother who ran an underground fight club out of her auto shop and a Filipino father who taught traditional Arnis in the back room. He was fighting professionally by fourteen, beating grown men in unsanctioned backyard bouts while his mothers' patrons placed bets. His unique hybrid style\u2014combining Arnis stick-work, Mexican street fighting instincts, and an almost inhuman sense of timing\u2014caught the eye of a retiring UFC veteran who became his coach. Now nineteen, Mateo represents everything old-school fighters fear: a kid with reflexes so fast he's been clocked dodging punches he'd already seen coming a full second earlier. He's untested at the highest levels, but every promoter knows his name. The question isn't whether he'll be a champion\u2014it's whether he can survive his own arrogance long enough to get there.",

    "Playfully mocks opponents during fights, often narrating their mistakes aloud",
    "Deeply loyal to his mothers and coach, violent protective streak toward anyone who threatens them",
    "Genuinely loves fighting - smiles during beatings, laughs when hurt"
  ],
  "fears_quirks": [
    "Fears disappointing his mothers more than losing",
    "Has never been truly hurt - doesn't know how he'll react when pain becomes overwhelming",

    "Collects one item from every opponent he defeats"
  ],
  "fighting_style": {
    "primary_style": "Hybrid martial arts (Arnis/Jeet Kune Do)",
    "secondary_style": "Mexican-style street boxing",
    "signature_move": "Mariposa Frenzy - Unpredictable flurry of spinning elbows, knee strikes, and butterfly-flutter footwork that creates a dizzying visual of movement, often catching opponents unable to track his location",
    "finishing_move": "Monarch's Kiss - Catches incoming opponent's head, uses their momentum to spin them into a controlled slam while driving elbow into temple or following with precise palm-heel strike to jaw",
    "known_weaknesses": [
      "Has never faced real power punchers - unknown how he'll handle genuine one-hit danger",
      "Tends to showboat and give opponents time to recover",
      "Limited cardio work due to natural talent - can be dragged into deep water",
      "Psychologically untested - no idea how he'll handle true adversity"
