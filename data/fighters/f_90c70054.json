  "ring_name": "BOREALIS",
  "real_name": "\u00c9lodie Beaumont",
  "age": 19,
  "origin": "Montreal, Quebec, Canada",
  "alignment": "face",
  "gender": "female",
  "height": "5'5\"",
  "weight": "135 lbs",
  "build": "Petite but deceptively powerful - compact frame with explosive lean muscle built from years of gymnastics and martial arts training. Looks like she could be a figure skater or ballet dancer rather than a fighter, with long legs, narrow waist, and graceful proportions that hide surprising density.",
  "distinguishing_features": "A small silver stud in her right nostril, faint scar on her chin from a childhood skating accident, abnormally flexible fingers from years of piano lessons, always has perfectly manicured nails painted in alternating French flag colors - blue, white, red. No tattoos - she considers them 'permanent mistakes.'",
  "ring_attire": "Wears a cropped white tactical jacket with red piping (Montreal Canadiens colors) over a fitted black sports bra. Below: high-waisted red compression shorts with white side stripes, the fabric cut high to display her legs. Fights in white leather high-top sneakers with red accents - she keeps them immaculate, polishing them before every match. Thin black fingerless gloves with red knuckle padding. Before entering, she removes her jacket in a single fluid motion, tossing it to her corner with theatrical grace.",
  "backstory": "\u00c9lodie was a child prodigy in everything she touched - piano competitions at seven, regional gymnastics championships at twelve, black belt in karate by fifteen. By seventeen, she'd exhausted every athletic challenge her hometown could offer and was spiraling into boredom when a street fight outside a Montreal nightclub caught her attention. She watched two men brutalize each other for six minutes and found it... beautiful. The economy of movement, the geometry of violence. She started training at an underground gym in the Plateau, sparring with fighters twice her age who dismissed her as a curiosity until she submitted them with techniques they couldn't comprehend. She turned pro at eighteen, winning her first eight fights by technical submission - all in the first round. The promotions call her 'BOREALIS' because she appears suddenly, displays impossible beauty, and leaves opponents seeing Northern Lights when she knocks them unconscious.",

  "fears_quirks": [
    "Fears being ordinary - mediocrity is her only nightmare",
    "Has a pre-fight ritual of tapping her gloves together exactly seven times, once for each year she started competing"

  "fighting_style": {
    "primary_style": "Karate (Kyokushin) - devastating leg kicks and precise striking from her competition background, adapted for MMA",
    "secondary_style": "Judo - throws and grappling from her complementary training, uses opponents' momentum against them",
    "signature_move": "Northern Lights - an unorthodox spinning backfist followed immediately by a roundhouse kick to the same side, creating a visual blur opponents compare to the aurora",
    "finishing_move": "Cold Star - a perfectly timed head kick thrown as opponents lunges forward, often landing while they're still reacting to her previous strike. She calls it 'the moment they realize they can't keep up.'",
    "known_weaknesses": [
      "Poor ground game - prefers to keep fights standing",
      "Struggles against aggressive pressure fighters who don't give her time to think"
