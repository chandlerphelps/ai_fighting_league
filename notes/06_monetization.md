# Monetization - Sponsorship, Investment & Fan Economy

## Overview

AFL's monetization is built on **fan attachment to characters**. The deeper a fan's
connection to a fighter, the more they'll engage with the economy. This isn't gambling
on random outcomes — it's investing in characters you believe in and want to see succeed.

The key insight: **fans who have skin in the game care more about every fight, every
training update, every story beat.**

## Revenue Streams

### 1. Fighter Sponsorship

Fans can directly sponsor a fighter's career. This is the primary engagement mechanic.

#### How It Works

- Fans pay real money to sponsor specific aspects of a fighter's development
- Sponsorship creates tangible in-world effects (better training, equipment, coaching)
- Sponsors get recognition and benefits tied to their fighter's success
- Sponsorship is framed narratively: "Fan X funded Vex's trip to train with the
  monks of Mount Koya" — not just a stat boost

#### Sponsorship Types

| Type | Cost Tier | Effect | Narrative |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Training Camp** | $$ | Skill stat boost (+1-3 to specific skill) | "A generous patron funded a 4-week wrestling camp with Coach Diaz" |
| **Equipment** | $ | Minor stat boost or injury prevention | "New custom gloves, better protective gear, or mystical artifacts" |
| **Coaching** | $$$ | Fight IQ boost, new technique unlocked | "Legendary coach joins the corner for the next fight" |
| **Medical** | $$ | Faster injury recovery | "Top surgeon repairs the torn ACL — back in 4 weeks instead of 8" |
| **Supernatural Training** | $$$$ | Supernatural stat boost or new ability | "Funded a pilgrimage to the source of her power" |
| **Mental Health** | $$ | Psychological stat recovery | "Sports psychologist helps rebuild confidence after devastating loss" |
| **Lifestyle** | $ | General morale/confidence boost | "A proper training facility, better nutrition, less financial stress" |
| **Recruitment** | $$$ | Attract a specific free agent to your fighter's gym/faction | "Convince a retired legend to come mentor your fighter" |

#### Sponsorship Rules
- Effects are real but not game-breaking (+1-5 stat points typically)
- Multiple fans can sponsor the same fighter — contributions stack up to a cap
- Sponsorship is narratively integrated (fans see the story of their investment)
- Fighters can only absorb so much sponsorship benefit at once (diminishing returns)
- Some sponsorships carry risk (supernatural training might have side effects)

### 2. Fighter Investment

Fans can "invest" in a fighter's career and receive returns based on performance.

#### How It Works

- Fans buy "shares" in a fighter at a price based on current ranking and trajectory
- Share price fluctuates based on wins, losses, title status, and story prominence
- Dividends are paid out based on fight purses (fighters earn prize money per fight)
- Investors can buy/sell shares on a marketplace

#### Investment Mechanics

```
SHARE PRICE FACTORS:
  Base value: Determined by ranking and win/loss record
  + Title holder bonus: Champions are worth more
  + Win streak multiplier: Consecutive wins increase value
  + Story prominence: Main event fighters are worth more
  - Loss deduction: Losses decrease value
  - Injury discount: Injured fighters lose value temporarily
  - Age decline: Aging fighters slowly lose value
  - Death = total loss: If a fighter dies, shares go to zero
```

#### Investment Tiers

| Tier | Investment | Benefits |
|---|---|---|
| **Fan** | Small investment | Basic returns on fighter earnings, name in supporter list |
| **Patron** | Medium investment | Better returns, early access to fighter content, minor input on training |
| **Backer** | Large investment | Significant returns, fighter acknowledgment, vote on non-critical career decisions |
| **Cornerstone** | Major investment | Top returns, named in fighter's story, influence on fight acceptance |

#### The Risk Factor
- **Losing fighters lose value**: Bad investments are possible
- **Injuries tank prices**: A major injury craters a fighter's share price
- **Death wipes investment**: This is the ultimate risk — invest in a death match fighter at your own peril
- **Comebacks create windfalls**: Buying low on a struggling fighter who then goes on a run = huge returns
- **New fighter IPOs**: New characters entering the league have an "IPO" moment where fans can buy in early

### 3. Event Access & Premium Content

| Product | Description | Price |
|---|---|---|
| **Fight Night Pass** | Access to the full fight card with live beat-by-beat feed | $ |
| **Mega Event Pass** | Premium access to quarterly PPV events | $$ |

| **The War Room** | Pre-fight analysis, probability breakdowns, expert picks | $$ |
| **Narrator's Cut** | Extended fight narratives with extra detail and alternate angles | $ |

### 4. Cosmetic & Personalization

|---|---|---|

| **Arena Themes** | Custom arena appearances for fight viewing | $ |

## The Fan Economy Flywheel

```
Fan discovers a fighter they connect with
  → Follows their story (free engagement)
    → Makes a small sponsorship (first purchase)
      → Sees tangible effect on fighter's career
        → Invests in the fighter's shares
          → Now deeply invested in every fight outcome
            → Tells friends about "their" fighter
              → Community grows
                → More fans, more investment, richer stories
```

## Prediction Markets

Fans can make predictions on fight outcomes for bragging rights and small rewards:

- **Fight Winner**: Pick the winner of each fight
- **Method of Victory**: Predict KO, submission, decision, or special
- **Round**: Predict which round the fight ends
- **Parlay**: Chain multiple correct predictions for multiplied rewards
- **Season Predictions**: Who will be champion at the end of the quarter?
- **Story Predictions**: What will happen in an ongoing arc? (risky but high reward)

> **Important**: This should feel like a **fantasy sports** experience, not sports betting.
> Predictions use an in-app currency earned through engagement, with premium currency
> available for purchase. Consult legal guidance on local gambling regulations.

## Economy Balance

### Preventing Pay-to-Win
- Sponsorship has hard caps per fighter per time period
- The best fighter in the league with zero sponsorship can still beat a max-sponsored fighter
- Sponsorship gives edges (5-10% improvement), not transformations
- Random outcomes mean money can't guarantee wins
- Story integrity comes first — the AI won't let sponsorship break a narrative

### Preventing Death Exploitation
- Fans can't force fighters into death matches for investment gains
- Death match entry requires story justification, not just money
- Insurance mechanics: fans can buy "death insurance" on their investments
- If a heavily-invested fighter dies, there's a partial refund mechanism

### Preventing Market Manipulation
- Share price changes are smoothed to prevent pump-and-dump schemes
- Large trades have a cooldown period
- Insider information (upcoming story beats) is never leaked
- Market activity is monitored for suspicious patterns

## Monetization Principles

1. **Story first**: No monetization decision should compromise narrative quality
2. **Value for money**: Every purchase should deliver something the fan genuinely values
3. **Not predatory**: No loot boxes, no hidden costs, no pay-walls on core content
4. **Community building**: Monetization should bring fans together, not divide them
5. **Narrative integration**: Money spent should feel like part of the world, not meta-gaming
6. **Risk is real**: The possibility of losing investment is what makes winning meaningful
7. **Free tier is viable**: Free fans should enjoy the full story; paying fans get extras and agency
