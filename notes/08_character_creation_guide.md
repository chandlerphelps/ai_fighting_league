# Character Creation Guide

## Purpose

This is the practical creator's guide for building new AFL fighters. Where
`02_fighter_system.md` defines the stat categories, archetypes, and profile structure
(the WHAT), this document provides the step-by-step process and decision frameworks
(the HOW).

Use this as a checklist every time a new fighter is created.

---

## Core Philosophy — Read This First

Everything below flows from these four principles. If a new character violates any of
them, stop and rework.

### 1. Female Characters Are Sexy and That's the Point

Design for a predominantly male audience. Female fighters should be charismatic, attractive,
and this should be **blatantly obvious in their outfit and gear design**. Crop tops, high-cut
leotards, sling bikinis, thigh-highs, mesh panels — lean into it without apology. Sex appeal
is a feature, not a bug. Confidence, allure, and willingness to weaponize beauty are core
to female character design in AFL.

### 2. Men Are Bigger and Stronger — Women Win Differently

Men should be physically larger and more powerful than women. **No female fighters whose
primary identity is being big and strong compared to the men.** Women compete through
seduction, charm, playing dirty, psychological warfare, debuffing, supernatural ability,
technical mastery, mysticism, poison, speed, precision — everything except raw physical
dominance. The size and strength gap is real and is part of what makes it interesting when
a woman beats a man twice her size through means other than out-muscling him.

### 3. Characters Are Interesting Because of Violence, Not Despite It

Attitude and personality alone don't make a character interesting. Magic alone doesn't make
a character interesting. What makes a character interesting is:

- **How they hurt others** — and how they feel about it. Do they enjoy it? Hate it? Feel
  nothing? Need it?
- **How they get hurt** — and how they react. Do they crumble? Get angry? Get quiet? Come
  back harder?

We want to know how they exist in a world where violence is the currency. Avoid purely
evil or purely good characters as a general rule. Keep 1-2 at most, and even those should
be 95/5 — the saint with one dark impulse, the monster with one shred of something human.

### 4. Steal From Everywhere — Archetypes From Popular Media

The roster shouldn't be 20 variations on "MMA fighter with magic." Reach into the full
vocabulary of popular media archetypes and bring them in pure form:

- **Technology**: Mech suits, cybernetic augmentation, powered armor, nanobots
- **Weapons**: Guns, blades, chains, exotic weaponry
- **Science**: Gene splicing, chemical enhancement, experimental drugs, combat stimulants
- **Faith**: Ancient Christian favor, divine wrath, holy warrior, exorcist
- **Subterfuge**: Poison, hypnotics, drugs, nerve agents, sleep darts
- **Tradition**: Ninja art, assassin training, monastery disciplines, tribal war magic
- **Pop culture pulls**: Find an archetype that works in anime, action movies, comics,
  video games, wrestling, mythology, or pulp fiction and ask "what does this look like
  as an AFL fighter?"

The best new characters often come from identifying a classic archetype from existing
media and translating it faithfully into the AFL world. A cyberpunk street samurai. A
voodoo priestess. A disgraced priest who fights with righteous fury. A cartel chemist
who poisons her opponents before the bell. These are more interesting starting points
than "fighter with unusual martial art."

## The Creation Workflow

Follow these 13 steps in order. Each step builds on the previous one.

### Step 1: Roster Audit

Before designing anything, check the existing roster for gaps and overlap. A new fighter
should fill a hole, not duplicate what's already covered.

**Quick-reference checklist of current coverage:**

| Category | Already Represented |
|---|---|
| **Origins** | Vietnam, Ireland, Mexico, France, Nigeria/England, USA (Atlanta, San Jose, Savannah, D.C., Boulder, Houston), Russia, Appalachia, Japan, Colombia, Sweden, England, Australia, USA (Chicago) |
| **Fighting Styles** | Wing Chun, bare-knuckle boxing, pressure boxing, savate/judo, London boxing/dirty MMA, MMA wrestling, combat sambo, catch wrestling, taekwondo, sumo/palm strikes, brawling/clinch, kickboxing/street fighting, BJJ/chain wrestling, glima/heavy boxing, karate/acrobatics, catch wrestling/dirty boxing, kickboxing/combat sambo, pure MMA |
| **Archetypes (Primary)** | Prodigy x3, Technician x3, Seductress x2, Wildcard x2, Monster x2, Mystic x1, Veteran x2, Experiment x2, Survivor x2, Legacy x1 |
| **Body Types** | Tiny/whip-thin (Whisper), lean/angular (Sable), sculpted/athletic (Golden Boy, Neon, Icon), statuesque/hourglass (Duchess, Vesper, Venom), massive (Butcher, Kaida), wiry/rangy (Switchblade), compact/gymnast (Sundance), amazonian (Valkyrie), raw-muscled (Redback), small/coiled (Banshee), functional/balanced (Crown, Apex, Specter), weathered/barrel-chested (Old Testament), nightmarish/asymmetric (Carrion King) |
| **Alignments** | Face x5 (Golden Boy, Switchblade, Neon, Valkyrie, Sundance, Apex), Heel x4 (Duchess, Butcher, Carrion King, Venom, Crown), Tweener x6 (Whisper, Sable, Icon, Vesper, Old Testament, Banshee, Redback, Specter) |
| **Supernatural** | Chi (Whisper, Sable, Apex), Psychic (Vesper, Crown, Specter), Elemental (Kaida, Sundance), Blood Rage (Kaida, Carrion King, Redback), Divine (Old Testament, Valkyrie), Dark Arts (Duchess, Venom, Carrion King, Banshee), Seduction (Duchess, Venom, Icon, Vesper, others minor) |
| **Non-supernatural** | Golden Boy, Switchblade, Neon, Butcher |

**What to look for:** If your concept overlaps heavily with an existing fighter in origin
AND style AND archetype, pivot. Minor overlaps are fine — two grapplers from different
backgrounds with different archetypes is fine. Two chi-using Irish counter-strikers is not.

### Step 2: Narrative Need

Ask: what does the current story need?

- A new **villain** to threaten established faces?
- A **challenger** for the current title picture?
- A **faction recruit** for an understrength faction?
- A **prospect** with raw talent and unknown ceiling?
- A **jobber/gatekeeper** to test rising fighters against?
- A **wild card** to disrupt an ongoing arc?
- A **connection point** to introduce a new lore element?

The best new fighters serve an immediate narrative function AND have long-term story potential.

### Step 3: Concept Hook

Write one sentence that captures what makes this fighter unique. If you can't say it in
one sentence, the concept needs refinement.

Good examples from the existing roster:
- "A 112-pound woman who dismantles giants through stillness and chi mastery" (Whisper)
- "A French aristocrat who makes violence look like ballet and uses her beauty as a weapon" (Duchess)
- "A 278-pound Colombian enforcer with no formal training who just shows up in the cage" (Butcher)
- "The most aggressively normal person in a league of freaks" (Apex)

Bad examples:
- "A strong fighter who uses magic" (generic, could be anyone)
- "A mysterious warrior from a hidden temple" (cliche without specificity)

### Step 4: Archetype Blend

Pick 2 from the 10 archetypes defined in `02_fighter_system.md`:

> Prodigy, Veteran, Monster, Technician, Wildcard, Mystic, Survivor, Seductress/Seductor,
> Experiment, Legacy

Identify which is **primary** (dominant personality/approach) and which is **secondary**
(adds texture and complication).

The blend should create internal tension. A Technician-Wildcard has a precise game plan
but an unpredictable streak. A Monster-Survivor is physically dominant but got here through
hardship, not privilege. The tension within the blend is where personality lives.

**Underrepresented blends on the current roster:**
- Legacy as primary (only Golden Boy has it, and as secondary)
- Survivor as primary with non-Monster secondary
- Veteran-Technician (the methodical old hand)
- Mystic-Seductress/Seductor (supernatural allure as primary identity)

### Step 5: Identity & Origin

- **Ring Name**: Should be instantly evocative. One or two words that conjure an image or
  feeling. "Carrion King" tells you everything. "The Duchess" tells you everything. If the
  ring name needs explanation, it's not working.
- **Real Name**: Should feel authentic to the character's cultural background. Research
  naming conventions for their origin.
- **Age**: Affects physical peak, experience, and story potential. Under 25 = still
  developing. 25-32 = peak. 33+ = declining physically, peaking mentally.
- **Hometown**: Specific is better than vague. "Darwin, Northern Territory, Australia" is
  better than "Australia." The hometown should inform personality.
- **Affiliation**: Independent, or tied to an existing faction/organization? Options include
  The Ashen Circle, Project Zarya, Halo Labs, La Maison, The Iron Temple, government
  enhancement programs, or something new.

### Step 6: Physical Design

See the **Visual Design Principles** section below. This step produces the full physical
description: build, skin, hair, eyes, distinguishing features, ring attire, entrance style.

### Step 7: Personality & Alignment

**Alignment guidelines:**

| Alignment | Core Trait | Fan Relationship | Mistake to Avoid |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Face** | Admirable quality the audience roots for | Fans cheer, invest, worry for them | Making them boring — faces need edge, flaws, and conflict too |
| **Heel** | Compelling quality the audience loves to hate | Fans boo, scheme against, secretly respect | Making them irredeemably evil — the best heels have a point |
| **Tweener** | Ambiguous morality that keeps fans guessing | Fans debate, argue, can't look away | Staying neutral forever — tweeners need to make choices eventually |

**Build personality from:**
- **Motivations**: Why do they fight? Money, glory, revenge, survival, fun, obligation,
  addiction to violence, something to prove? The best fighters have layered motivations.
- **Fears**: What genuinely scares them? This is where weakness lives.
  Crown fears losing intellectual superiority. Whisper fears emotional connection breaking
  her composure. Golden Boy fears he'll never escape his father's shadow.
- **Quirks**: Specific behavioral details that make them feel real. Banshee bites when
  grabbed by the hair. Old Testament carries a book he never opens. Redback always seems
  to be chewing something. These details are gold.

### Step 8: Fighting Style

See the **Fighting Style Construction** section below. Produces primary style, secondary
style, win condition, and style description.

### Step 9: Signature & Finishing Moves

See the **Signature & Finishing Move Design** section below. Produces 2-3 signatures and
1 finisher with names, descriptions, and setup conditions.

### Step 10: Stat Assignment

See the **Stat Assignment Framework** section below. Produces the full stat block: physical
attributes, combat skills, psychological attributes, and supernatural stats (if any).

### Step 11: Weaknesses

See the **Weakness Architecture** section below. Produces at least 2 genuine, exploitable
weaknesses — one physical/tactical, one psychological.

### Step 12: Story Seeds

Write 2-3 hooks that connect the new fighter to the existing world:

- A **rivalry seed**: Who on the roster would they clash with, and why?
- A **mystery seed**: What about their past is unresolved?
- A **arc seed**: What's the first story the audience should follow?

Story seeds should create natural entry points without over-committing future narrative.
"She trained under the same master as Whisper" opens possibilities. "She will betray
Whisper in Episode 47" closes them.

### Step 13: Image Generation Notes

Write pixel art portrait direction following the established format:
1. Physical details (build, skin, hair, eyes, distinguishing features)
2. Outfit description (ring attire, accessories)
3. Expression directive (what emotion/attitude should read)
4. Background directive (color palette, mood, thematic elements)

Follow the format used in `roster/initial_roster.md`. Every entry starts with
"Pixel art portrait:" and emphasizes human qualities first.

## Visual Design Principles

### The Strip Test

> Remove all supernatural effects from the character. Are they still visually compelling
> and distinct through human qualities alone? If not, the design needs more work.

This is the single most important design principle. Every fighter must pass it.

Whisper without chi glow is still a tiny, intense woman with an asymmetric haircut, white
hand wraps, and an unsettling stare. Compelling. The Duchess without any magical element is
still a statuesque platinum blonde in a white leotard and thigh-highs smirking at you like
you're beneath her. Compelling.

If your character is only interesting because they glow, they are not interesting.

### Human Qualities Carry the Design

What makes a character visually memorable is always human:

- **Expression**: Crown's cold intellectual appraisal. Banshee's feral grin. Butcher's dead
  calm. Old Testament's righteous stillness. The face tells the story.
- **Outfit**: Ring attire expresses personality louder than any magical effect. Duchess's
  white leotard with gold filigree says "I'm at a gala, not a cage fight." Banshee's ripped
  denim shorts and ratty Converse say "I came here to break things." Redback's olive sports
  bra and khaki shorts say "I'm here to work." Crown's immaculate white-and-gold says
  "I'm already better than you."
- **Body language**: How they carry themselves. Valkyrie's warrior posture. Venom's
  deliberate hip roll. Switchblade's coiled, restless scanning. Apex's focused shadowboxing.
- **Physicality**: Body type tells a story. Butcher's massive gut hiding slabs of core
  muscle. Banshee's coiled-spring wiry frame. Old Testament's weathered, dense muscle.
  Specter's angular, forged-by-hardship build.
- **Style details**: Scars, tattoos, jewelry, hair choices. Switchblade's keloid scar and
  gold-tipped locs. Crown's gold-thread braids. Redback's crocodile scar and twice-broken
  nose. These are the details fans remember.

### Silhouette Rule

A well-designed fighter is recognizable from their outline alone. Kaida's massive frame
with flowing hair is distinct from Butcher's hunched, gut-forward silhouette. Banshee's
small, spiky profile is distinct from Sundance's compact, ponytailed shape.

Test: describe the character's silhouette in one sentence. If it sounds like someone
else on the roster, differentiate further.

### Sex Appeal

AFL leans into attractiveness — this is explicit in the design philosophy
(see `01_vision_and_overview.md`). But sex appeal comes from human qualities:

- **Confidence**: Duchess's amused condescension. Icon's magazine-cover awareness.
  Venom's predatory smile.
- **Physique**: Golden Boy's sculpted build. Valkyrie's amazonian frame. Icon's
  Greek-god proportions.
- **Outfit**: Duchess's plunging leotard. Venom's painted-on black ensemble. Vesper's
  clinical sling bikini top.
- **Expression**: Venom's all-teeth smile. Duchess's heavy-lidded amusement. Icon's
  intense-but-warm eye contact.

What NOT to do: Use "faint [color] energy emanates from their body" or "an aura of
desire radiates outward" as a substitute for actual visual design. Supernatural allure
is an amplifier for characters that already work. It is never the source.

### Distinguishing Features

Every fighter needs a minimum of 2-3 unique physical details that fans latch onto:

- Scars (Switchblade's keloid, Redback's crocodile scar, Sable's eyebrow-to-cheekbone slash)
- Tattoos (Kaida's full irezumi, Crown's Adinkra pendant, Venom's snake on ring finger)
- Heterochromia or unusual eyes (Sable's mismatched green/olive, Kaida's amber-gold,
  Carrion King's solid white)
- Hair (Banshee's hot pink buzzcut, Crown's gold-thread braids, Whisper's asymmetric cut
  with white streak)
- Body quirks (Switchblade's missing pinky tip, Banshee's chipped tooth, Old Testament's
  scarred fists)

### Image Generation Notes Format

Follow this pattern for every fighter:

```
Pixel art portrait: [Physical build and skin]. [Hair description]. [Eye description
and what they convey]. [Distinguishing features]. [Outfit — ring attire with detail].
[Key visual hook — the one thing that makes them instantly recognizable].
Expression: [emotion/attitude in 3-5 words]. Background: [color palette, mood, motifs].
```

### What NOT to Do

These patterns were identified during the roster rework and removed:

| Removed Pattern | What Replaced It |
|---|---|
| "Faint emerald energy wisps around her hands" | Celtic knotwork sleeve tattoos that seem to shift in low light |
| "An aura of supernatural allure radiates from her" | "Too-perfect proportions, cold clinical beauty — disturbing, not enchanting" |
| "Mystical golden light surrounds his fists" | Faint shimmer around fists "that could be sweat catching the light, or something else" |
| "Her eyes glow with psychic power" | "Cool, appraising dark brown eyes with cutting intellectual intensity" |
| Generic "energy crackling" as identity | Specific human details (scars, expression, outfit, posture) |

The rule: supernatural effects are **one optional ingredient**, never the main course.
When present, they should be subtle, ambiguous, or grounded in something physical (tattoos
that seem to move, veins that darken, eyes that catch light strangely).

---

## Stat Assignment Framework

### Stat Ranges by Archetype

These are typical distributions, not mandatory. Use them as starting points, then adjust
for the specific character.

| Archetype | Physicals | Combat Skills | Psychological | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Prodigy** | 70-85 | 65-80 | 40-60 | Talented but mentally untested. High ceiling, current gaps. |
| **Veteran** | 55-70 | 80-95 | 75-90 | Declining body, elite skills and experience. Fight IQ near max. |
| **Monster** | 80-95 | 50-70 | Varies | Physically dominant. Skills are functional, not refined. |
| **Technician** | 60-75 | 80-90 | 70-85 | Not the most athletic, but the most skilled. High composure and fight IQ. |
| **Wildcard** | Uneven | Uneven | Uneven | Some stats 85+, some below 50. The distribution IS the character. |
| **Mystic** | 55-70 | 60-75 | 60-80 | Moderate across the board. Supernatural stats are the differentiator. |
| **Survivor** | 50-65 | 55-70 | 85+ (resilience, composure, heart) | Outstatted everywhere except the stats that keep you alive. |
| **Seductress/Seductor** | 55-75 | Specialized | 65-80 | Seduction stat is primary weapon. Combat skills lean toward specific strengths. |
| **Experiment** | Artificially high in 2-3 areas | Enhanced | Varies (often unstable) | Stats may be elite but with instability flags. |
| **Legacy** | 65-80 | 65-80 | 55-75 (confidence issues) | Well-rounded foundation. The gap is mental, not physical. |

### Power Level Tiers

Not every new fighter is a contender. Determine where they enter the roster:

| Tier | Description | Approximate Total Stat Budget | Role |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Prospect** | Lower overall, ceiling unknown | Below average across the board, spikes in 1-2 areas | Fresh talent, building a record. Losses are expected and educational. |
| **Gatekeeper** | Solid mid-range | Competitive but not elite in any single area | Tests rising fighters. Beating a gatekeeper means something. |
| **Contender** | High stats, ready to challenge | Elite in key areas, competitive everywhere | Title picture. Every fight matters for rankings. |
| **Champion** | Elite in key areas, complete package | Multiple stats at 85+, no critical weaknesses | The standard everyone else is measured against. |

New fighters should almost never debut at Champion tier. Contender-tier debuts need strong
narrative justification (established reputation from another circuit, returning legend, etc.).

### Supernatural Stats

- **Default is 0.** Most fighters have zero supernatural abilities.
- When present, supernatural stats should **always come with drawbacks**: Chi mastery that
  breaks under emotional disruption. Psychic ability that causes nosebleeds and tremors.
  Blood rage that makes you reckless and predictable.
- **Cap at 85 for new characters.** Only established roster members with narrative
  development should push higher.
- **Maximum 1-2 supernatural stats per fighter.** A fighter with Arcane Power AND Elemental
  Affinity AND Psychic Ability is overdesigned. Pick one or two that define the character.

### Seduction Stat Note

Seduction is in the supernatural stat block for convenience, but it is **primarily human**.
A Seduction 40 fighter might have zero supernatural abilities — they're just attractive,
confident, and know how to use it. The stat tracks effectiveness, not mechanism.

The mechanism is always specific and human: Duchess's outfit choices and condescending
smirk. Venom's Southern drawl and deliberate body language. Icon's magazine-cover physicality
and warm eye contact. These fighters don't cast charm spells. They make you lose focus
because they're compelling people who know exactly what they're doing.

Supernaturally enhanced seduction (Vesper's uncanny-valley beauty, for instance) is the
exception, not the norm. When it exists, it should feel unsettling rather than magical.

---

## Fighting Style Construction

### Base Style

Every fighter's primary style must be a **real martial art or recognizable discipline**:

- Boxing (various national styles: Mexican pressure, British technical, bare-knuckle)
- Muay Thai / Muay Boran
- Wrestling (freestyle, Greco-Roman, catch, folk, sumo, glima)
- BJJ / submission grappling
- Judo
- Karate (various styles)
- Taekwondo
- Savate
- Sambo / combat sambo
- Wing Chun / kung fu variants
- Kickboxing
- Street fighting (a valid "style" in this world)
- Pankration (ancient Greek combat — Carrion King's base)

### Secondary Style

The secondary style should either **complement** the primary (wrestling + BJJ = complete
ground game) or **create interesting tension** (savate + judo = elegant striking + brutal
throws, which is exactly what makes Duchess interesting).

### Supernatural Modifications

When a fighter has supernatural abilities, those abilities **modify technique — they don't
replace skill.**

- Whisper's chi mastery enhances her Wing Chun. Without it, she's still a trained fighter.
  With it, she's precognitive.
- Kaida's elemental fire augments his sumo-influenced palm strikes. Without it, the strikes
  are devastating. With it, they're concussive and thermal.
- Crown's latent psychic ability amplifies her pattern recognition in BJJ. Without it,
  she's still a world-class grappler. With it, she reads you before you commit.

The martial art is the foundation. The supernatural element is the amplifier.

### Win Condition

Every fighter needs a clear **path to victory** — the scenario where their skills and
attributes combine for a finish:

- Whisper wins by keeping distance and dismantling opponents with precision counters
- Butcher wins by closing distance, smothering in the clinch, and overwhelming with power
- Crown wins by getting the fight to the ground and executing methodical submission chains
- Banshee wins by creating chaos, disrupting rhythm, and landing wild shots in the scramble

If you can't articulate the win condition in one sentence, the fighting style needs
more focus.

### Matchup Dynamics

Consider how the new fighter's style interacts with existing roster members:

| Against... | Questions to Answer |
|---|---|
| **Strikers** | Can they close distance or keep range? How do they handle volume? |
| **Grapplers** | What's their takedown defense? Can they fight off their back? |
| **Pressure fighters** | Can they handle the pace? Do they have a reset mechanism? |
| **Counter-fighters** | Are they patient enough not to overcommit? Can they feint? |
| **Supernatural users** | Do they have mental fortitude? Focus? Composure? |

### Style Connects to Story

Where and how a fighter learned their style should be embedded in their backstory:

- Switchblade's London boxing + dirty MMA comes from underground warehouse fights
- Old Testament's bare-knuckle boxing comes from decades of Appalachian violence
- Golden Boy's pressure boxing was inherited from his legendary father
- Vesper's combat sambo was implanted/enhanced by Project Zarya

The training origin is story material. It connects to mentors, factions, locations, and
history.

---

## Signature & Finishing Move Design

### Moves Reflect Personality

The best moves in the roster are inseparable from the character who throws them:

- **Duchess** mouths "bonsoir" before landing her head kick. The elegance and contempt are
  the character in microcosm.
- **Venom** whispers to opponents during her rear-naked choke. Nobody has ever revealed
  what she says. The mystery IS the character.
- **Crown's** finisher is called "Magna Cum Laude." Her intellectual superiority complex
  is baked into the name.
- **Old Testament's** single right hand from a dead stop is called "Judgment Day." A
  preacher's finality in one punch.
- **Carrion King** walks through everything with zero defensive concern. "Carrion Call"
  is the sound of something that can't be stopped and doesn't care about getting hit.

### Finisher Design Requirements

| Requirement | Why |
|---|---|
| **Setup conditions** | Finishers aren't just "big punch." They require the fighter to create the right situation. Sable needs to fully download the opponent before the Blackout Waltz. Neon needs the body kick to fold them before the flying knee. |
| **Visual distinctiveness** | It needs to look unique in pixel art. A leaping move, an unusual angle, a distinctive pre-move gesture — something the sprite animation team can make iconic. |
| **Named for character** | The name should evoke the character, not just describe the technique. "Judgment Day" is better than "Big Right Hand." "Bonsoir" is better than "High Kick." |
| **"What makes it scary"** | The best finishers have a reputation. The Killing Floor is the ugliest finish in the league. Judgment Day has ended 15 careers. The Redback Bite isn't a choke — it's a crank, and opponents tap immediately or risk real injury. |

### Signature Moves

Each fighter gets 2-3 signature moves. These are techniques they use regularly that fans
identify with them, but they're not fight-enders:

- They should showcase the fighting style (Whisper's "Raven's Eye" counter cross
  demonstrates her chi-reading ability)
- They should have names that build the character's brand
- They should be visually recognizable in the fight narrative

---

## Weakness Architecture

### Every Strength Implies a Vulnerability

This is the foundational principle. Map it directly:

| Strength | Implied Vulnerability |
|---|---|
| Fast | Fragile — can they take a shot? |
| Powerful | Slow — can they catch movers? |
| Technically brilliant | Inflexible — what happens when the plan breaks? |
| Aggressive | Exploitable — do they leave openings? |
| Composed | Passive — can they create offense, not just respond? |
| Supernaturally gifted | Dependent — what happens when the power fails? |
| Durable | One-dimensional — can they win, or just survive? |

### Minimum Requirements

Every fighter needs at minimum:
1. **One physical/tactical weakness**: A style matchup, a physical limitation, or a gap
   in their skill set that specific opponents can exploit
2. **One psychological weakness**: An emotional trigger, a mental fragility, or a behavioral
   pattern that compromises their performance

### Weaknesses Create Matchups

Design weaknesses with specific roster members in mind:

- Crown's inability to adapt when her model breaks means chaotic fighters like Banshee
  and Carrion King are her worst matchups
- Whisper's emotional fragility means anyone who can get under her skin (Venom's
  whispering, Duchess's condescension) disrupts her chi connection
- Neon's weakness to elite wrestlers means Icon and Venom are dangerous opponents
- Butcher's limited gas tank means Sable and Whisper can outpoint him from the outside
  if they survive the early rounds

When designing a new fighter's weaknesses, check: which 2-3 existing fighters would
exploit these weaknesses? If no one can, the weaknesses aren't real.

### Genuinely Exploitable, Not Flavor Text

Bad weakness: "Sometimes lacks confidence." This doesn't mean anything mechanically
or narratively.

Good weakness: "Crown's entire approach depends on her predictive model of the opponent.
When someone fights irrationally — pure chaos, no patterns — her reads fail and she has
never needed a Plan B." This tells you exactly who beats her and why.

Bad weakness: "Can be reckless." Vague, applies to anyone.

Good weakness: "Redback's blood rage, once triggered, makes her abandon technique for
raw aggression. She becomes stronger but predictable and defensively reckless. Disciplined
fighters can time her." This tells you the specific conditions and consequences.

### The Best Weaknesses Are Also What Make the Character Interesting

- Crown's inability to adapt is also what makes her so dominant when it works — total
  commitment to the model
- Whisper's emotional fragility is the flip side of the chi connection that makes her
  dangerous
- Golden Boy's heart-on-his-sleeve emotionality makes him a fan favorite AND makes him
  easy to rattle

If the weakness doesn't connect to what makes the character compelling, it feels tacked on.

---

## Connecting to the Existing World

### Connection Requirements

Every new fighter needs **at minimum 2 connections** to the existing world:

- **Shared origin**: Trained at the same gym, from the same country, part of the same
  program (Project Zarya, Halo Labs, The Iron Temple, etc.)
- **Rivalry**: Natural stylistic clash or personal beef with an existing fighter
- **Faction**: Recruit for or defector from The Ashen Circle, La Maison, or another group
- **Training history**: Studied under the same mentor, fought in the same underground circuit
- **Narrative mirror**: Thematic parallel to an existing character (another Legacy fighter
  dealing with parental shadow, another Experiment wrestling with identity)

Alternatively, the new fighter can **introduce a new element that enriches the world**: a
new faction, a new origin location, a new supernatural tradition, a new mystery. But even
then, the new element should connect to existing lore. A new faction that has no relationship
to any existing character is floating in a vacuum.

### Established Lore Elements to Reference

| Element | What It Is | Connected Fighters |
|---|---|---|
| **The Ashen Circle** | Mysterious faction with supernatural ties | Sable (former member) |
| **Project Zarya** | Russian government enhancement program | Vesper (subject), Specter (second subject) |
| **Halo Labs** | Technology/enhancement company | Neon (LED implants) |
| **La Maison** | (Duchess's world — French, elegant, likely factional) | Duchess |
| **The Iron Temple** | Training location tied to spiritual awakening | Kaida (awakened there) |
| **Government enhancement programs** | Various state-sponsored fighter programs | Redback (Australian program, "missing years") |

### Writing Backstory That Plants Hooks

Good backstory creates openings without locking in future plot:

**Do:**
- "She left The Ashen Circle under circumstances she refuses to discuss" — opens questions
- "He trained alongside Golden Boy's father decades ago" — connects to existing lore
- "The scars on her temples match the pattern seen on Project Zarya subjects" — creates mystery
- "She arrived in the league the same week Carrion King disappeared for three days" — implies
  connection without confirming it

**Don't:**
- "She will eventually betray her faction in Episode 12" — pre-scripts the story
- "He is secretly the son of The Resurrectionist" — locks in a reveal before the story earns it
- "Her ultimate destiny is to become champion" — removes dramatic tension

Plant seeds. Let the narrative system decide what grows.

## Roster Balance Checklist

Quick-reference table for current roster distribution. Check this before finalizing a
new character to ensure they contribute to balance:

### By Size

| Size Category | Fighters | Count |
|---|---|---|
| **Small** (under 5'5" / 130 lbs) | Whisper (5'1"/112), Banshee (5'4"/125) | 2 |
| **Medium** (5'5"-5'8" / 130-165 lbs) | Sable, Golden Boy, Duchess, Sundance, Venom, Crown, Switchblade | 7 |

### By Gender

| Gender | Count |
|---|---|
| Female | 13 (Whisper, Sable, Duchess, Vesper, Venom, Valkyrie, Banshee, Crown, Sundance, Redback, Specter, Apex, Venom) |
| Male | 7 (Golden Boy, Switchblade, Icon, Old Testament, Neon, Butcher, Kaida, Carrion King) |

### By Alignment

| Alignment | Fighters | Count |
|---|---|---|
| **Face** | Golden Boy, Switchblade, Neon, Valkyrie, Sundance, Apex, Kaida | 7 |
| **Heel** | Duchess, Butcher, Carrion King, Venom, Crown | 5 |
| **Tweener** | Whisper, Sable, Icon, Vesper, Old Testament, Banshee, Redback, Specter | 8 |

### By Geographic Origin

| Region | Fighters |
|---|---|
| **North America** | Golden Boy (Mexico), Icon (Atlanta), Neon (San Jose), Venom (Savannah), Crown (D.C.), Sundance (Boulder), Apex (Houston), Old Testament (Appalachia), Specter (Chicago) |
| **Europe** | Sable (Dublin), Duchess (Lyon), Switchblade (Lagos→London), Vesper (Saint Petersburg), Valkyrie (Gothenburg), Banshee (Manchester) |
| **Asia-Pacific** | Whisper (Hanoi), Kaida (Osaka), Redback (Darwin) |
| **South America** | Butcher (Bogota) |
| **Unknown** | Carrion King |

**Underrepresented**: Africa (direct), Middle East, Central Asia, Eastern Europe (beyond
Russia), Caribbean, Pacific Islands.

### By Supernatural Status

| Status | Count | Fighters |
|---|---|---|
| **Has supernatural abilities** | 16 | Whisper, Sable, Duchess, Vesper, Kaida, Carrion King, Venom, Valkyrie, Banshee, Crown, Sundance, Redback, Specter, Apex, Old Testament, Icon |
| **No supernatural abilities** | 4 | Golden Boy, Switchblade, Neon, Butcher |

**Note**: Supernatural fighters heavily outnumber non-supernatural. New non-supernatural
fighters — people who compete on pure skill, grit, and human ability — are valuable
for roster balance and make the supernatural elements feel more special by contrast.

### What's Underrepresented = Opportunity

- Male fighters (only 7-8 of 20)
- Non-supernatural fighters (only 4 of 20)
- African / Middle Eastern / Central Asian origins
- Small fighters (only 2)
- Legacy archetype as primary
- Pure strikers without grappling fallbacks
- Heel faces that aren't also seductors/technicians

## Common Mistakes

1. **Generic glow effects as primary visual identity.** If the character's most notable
   visual feature is that they glow, redo the design. Pass the strip test.

2. **"Supernatural seduction" substituting for actual personality.** Seduction should work
   through specific human behaviors: how they dress, move, talk, look at you. "Mystical
   allure" without specific mechanism is lazy.

3. **No genuine weaknesses.** If you can't name 2-3 existing roster members who would give
   this fighter serious trouble, the weaknesses aren't real.

4. **Backstory disconnected from existing world.** A fighter whose history doesn't touch
   any existing character, faction, location, or lore element is floating in space. At least
   2 connections.

5. **Duplicate archetype/style in an already crowded slot.** Check the roster audit. If we
   already have three Prodigies, your Prodigy needs a strong reason to exist.

6. **Power levels that break matchup dynamics.** A new fighter shouldn't be unbeatable by
   anyone on the current roster. If you can't identify their bad matchups, they're
   overpowered.

7. **Overly complex supernatural systems for a new character.** A debut fighter should
   have 0-2 supernatural stats, not a bespoke magic system. Complexity is earned through
   narrative development, not character creation.

8. **Forgetting the strip test.** Say it again: remove the supernatural effects. Is the
   character still visually compelling, personality-rich, and distinct? If not, do more work
   on the human foundation before adding anything else.

## Worked Example

Walk-through of the full 13-step process for a hypothetical new fighter.

### Step 1: Roster Audit

Checking gaps: The roster is light on male fighters, non-supernatural fighters, and
African/Middle Eastern origins. Legacy as a primary archetype is barely represented.
There's no pure Muay Thai fighter.

### Step 2: Narrative Need

The current roster lacks a clear gatekeeper — a solid mid-tier fighter whose role is
to test rising prospects. The story needs someone who exists to answer the question:
"Are you good enough?"

### Step 3: Concept Hook

**"A retired Muay Thai champion's son who fights like his father's ghost is watching
every round — because in his mind, it is."**

### Step 4: Archetype Blend

**Primary: Legacy** — defined by his relationship to his father's legend.
**Secondary: Veteran** — despite being only 28, he's been fighting since 15. His body
fights older than his age.

### Step 5: Identity & Origin

- **Ring Name**: "The Heir"
- **Real Name**: Kofi Asante
- **Age**: 28
- **Hometown**: Accra, Ghana (trained in Bangkok, Thailand from age 12)
- **Affiliation**: Independent. Formerly trained at the legendary Sitsongpeenong gym in
  Bangkok, but left after his father's death under unclear circumstances.

### Step 6: Physical Design

- **Height/Weight**: 5'11" / 172 lbs
- **Build**: Lean, corded muscle — a traditional Muay Thai body. Long arms, iron shins,
  narrow waist. Every muscle earned through pad work and clinch sparring, not a gym.
- **Skin**: Deep brown, smooth except for the scars
- **Hair**: Cropped close, natural black, with a single line shaved into the right side —
  his father's signature
- **Eyes**: Dark brown, steady. Old eyes in a young face. He looks at opponents the way a
  teacher looks at a student who isn't ready.
- **Distinguishing Features**: A prominent scar across the bridge of his nose from a
  headbutt in his Bangkok days. Traditional Sak Yant tattoo (twin tigers) across his
  shoulder blades — hand-poked by a monk his father knew. His shins are visibly calcified
  from years of conditioning. Wears his father's gold armband (mongkol) on his left bicep
  during fights.
- **Ring Attire**: Deep red Muay Thai shorts with gold trim and Ghanaian Adinkra symbols
  stitched into the waistband, red hand wraps, no shoes, no shirt. Traditional and
  functional.
- **Entrance Style**: Thai traditional music that transitions into Ghanaian highlife. He
  performs the Wai Kru (traditional pre-fight dance) with slow, deliberate precision.
  Every movement is respectful. The crowd quiets instinctively.

### Step 7: Personality & Alignment

- **Alignment**: Face (quiet, earned respect)
- **Personality**: Reserved, watchful, respectful to everyone but especially to his
  opponents. Speaks softly in accented English with occasional Thai phrases. Never trash
  talks — considers it disrespectful to the art. Has a dry, unexpected sense of humor that
  surfaces in post-fight interviews. Carries himself with the quiet dignity of someone who
  has already proven everything he needs to prove — except the one thing he can't.
- **Motivations**: Honoring his father's legacy while trying to step out of it. Proving
  Muay Thai can stand against any style. Earning enough to support his mother and sisters
  in Accra.
- **Fears**: That he'll never be as good as his father. That his father's death wasn't an
  accident. That the body is breaking down sooner than it should.
- **Quirks**: Always touches his father's gold armband before the bell. Bows to his opponent
  after every fight regardless of outcome. Eats the same meal before every fight (his
  mother's jollof rice, shipped frozen from Accra).

### Step 8: Fighting Style

- **Primary Style**: Muay Thai (traditional, clinch-heavy, with elite elbows and knees)
- **Secondary Style**: Ghanaian bare-knuckle boxing (his father's original art before
  Thailand — raw, heavy-handed, unorthodox angles)
- **Win Condition**: Establish the clinch, punish with elbows and knees until the
  opponent wilts, then finish with strikes or the standing TKO.
- **Style Description**: Kofi fights patient, traditional Muay Thai with an iron chin and
  an educated clinch. He uses teeps and long kicks to manage distance, then walks through
  strikes to clinch range where his elbows and knees are devastating. His father's
  bare-knuckle boxing surfaces in unexpected moments — orthodox combinations thrown from
  angles that Muay Thai doesn't teach.

### Step 9: Signature & Finishing Moves

- **Signature 1: "The Sitsongpeenong Elbow"** — A slicing downward elbow from the clinch
  that opens cuts. Kofi turns his hips into it exactly the way his father did in old
  fight tapes. Commentators have noted the resemblance.
- **Signature 2: "Father's Hand"** — An unorthodox overhand right from bare-knuckle
  boxing, thrown off-rhythm in the middle of a Thai combination. It's the punch that
  doesn't belong, and it lands because of it.
- **Finishing Move: "The Inheritance"** — From the clinch, a sharp knee to the body that
  folds the opponent, then a standing elbow dropped onto the back of the head as they
  buckle. He pauses for a half-second before the elbow — an instant of hesitation or
  respect that somehow makes it more devastating when it comes. Opponents who've been
  finished by it say the pause is the worst part.

### Step 10: Stat Assignment

Power level: **Gatekeeper** (solid mid-range, tests rising fighters).

**Physical Attributes:**
| Stat | Value | Reasoning |
|---|---|---|
| Strength | 72 | Clinch strength and stopping power. Not a knockout artist from range. |
| Speed | 65 | Adequate, not explosive. Fights at his pace, not yours. |
| Endurance | 78 | Championship-level cardio from years of Thai training. |
| Durability | 80 | Iron chin. Has absorbed shots from heavy hitters and kept coming. |
| Flexibility | 70 | Good enough for head kicks, nothing acrobatic. |
| Size | 68 | Average frame. Doesn't overwhelm or get overwhelmed. |
| Reach | 70 | Long arms for his height. Good for the clinch and teeps. |
| Recovery | 62 | Slowing down. Takes longer between fights to feel right. |

**Combat Skills:**
| Stat | Value | Reasoning |
|---|---|---|
| Striking | 80 | Elite-level Muay Thai striking. His bread and butter. |
| Kicking | 82 | Traditional Thai kicks — heavy, accurate, leg-destroying. |
| Wrestling | 45 | Not a wrestler. If he's on the ground, things are bad. |
| Grappling | 38 | Significant gap. Submission defense is instinct, not training. |
| Clinch Work | 88 | World-class. This is where he lives. |
| Defense | 72 | Solid but relies on durability more than evasion. |
| Fight IQ | 78 | Experienced and intelligent. Adjusts well between rounds. |
| Finishing Instinct | 70 | Will find the finish if you give him the opening. Not a killer. |

**Psychological:**
| Stat | Value | Reasoning |
|---|---|---|
| Aggression | 55 | Patient. Lets the fight come to him. |
| Composure | 82 | Rock-solid. Rarely rattled. |
| Confidence | 60 | Competent but haunted by the comparison. Big stage nerves. |
| Intimidation | 65 | Quietly intimidating through skill, not theatrics. |
| Resilience | 80 | Will not quit. Has fought through broken bones. |
| Focus | 75 | Disciplined. Sticks to the game plan. |
| Killer Instinct | 55 | The hesitation before "The Inheritance" is real. He doesn't love hurting people. |
| Emotional Stability | 70 | Steady except when his father is invoked. |

**Supernatural:** All zeros. Kofi has no supernatural abilities. He's a human being who
fights with skill, toughness, and technique. In a league of mystics and experiments, that's
its own kind of remarkable.

### Step 11: Weaknesses

1. **Wrestlers and grapplers** (tactical): With wrestling at 45 and grappling at 38, any
   elite grappler who gets him down is in dominant position. Venom, Crown, and Icon are
   nightmare matchups. He knows it. He trains for it. It's still not enough.

2. **His father's shadow** (psychological): Mention his father — "El Toro" Kwame Asante,
   who died in a fight ten years ago — and Kofi's composure cracks. Opponents who research
   him know this. A well-timed reference to his father mid-fight can break his focus and
   turn his patient Muay Thai into desperate, emotional brawling. Golden Boy, as another
   Legacy fighter living under a father's reputation, would be a fascinating mirror match.

### Step 12: Story Seeds

1. **Rivalry seed**: Kofi and Golden Boy are natural foils — both Legacy fighters, both
   living in famous fathers' shadows, both trying to forge their own identity. But their
   approaches are opposite: Golden Boy is flashy, emotional, a showman. Kofi is quiet,
   disciplined, respectful. They'd respect each other and fight like they have something
   to prove. This is a ready-made feud.

2. **Mystery seed**: Kofi's father died in a fight ten years ago. The official ruling was
   "ring accident." But Kofi left the Sitsongpeenong gym abruptly after his father's death,
   and he won't say why. What did he learn? Is there a connection to any existing factions?
   The Iron Temple, where Kaida awakened, has ties to traditional martial arts culture in
   Asia — did Kofi's father train there too?

3. **Arc seed**: Kofi debuts as the gatekeeper — the measuring stick for rising prospects.
   But as he racks up wins, the question becomes: is he still his father's echo, or is he
   becoming something new? The first time he deviates from his father's style in a fight —
   the first time he throws a technique that isn't in any of Kwame Asante's old fight
   tapes — that's the moment.

### Step 13: Image Generation Notes

Pixel art portrait: Lean, corded Muay Thai build with deep brown smooth skin. Close-cropped
black hair with a single shaved line on the right side. Steady dark brown eyes — old eyes
in a young face, looking at you like a teacher assessing a student. Prominent scar across
the bridge of his nose. Traditional Sak Yant twin tigers tattoo visible across shoulder
blades. Gold armband (mongkol) on left bicep. Deep red Muay Thai shorts with gold trim and
Adinkra symbols on waistband, red hand wraps, barefoot, shirtless. Calcified shins visible.
Expression: calm, respectful, quietly confident — the dignity of someone with nothing left
to prove. Background: deep red with gold accents, Thai temple silhouette, faint Adinkra
patterns.

### The Heir — Final Check

- [x] Passes the strip test (no supernatural elements to remove)
- [x] Silhouette distinct from roster (lean Thai fighter build, Sak Yant tattoo,
  gold armband)
- [x] 2+ roster connections (Golden Boy mirror, Iron Temple/Kaida possible link,
  gatekeeper role against multiple fighters)
- [x] Genuine weaknesses exploitable by specific roster members (Crown, Venom, Icon
  on the ground; anyone who invokes his father psychologically)
- [x] Fills roster gaps (male, non-supernatural, African origin, Legacy primary,
  pure Muay Thai, gatekeeper role)
- [x] Immediate narrative hook (father's mysterious death) + long-term arc potential
  (becoming his own fighter)
- [x] Human qualities carry the design (the armband, the scar, the old eyes, the
  respectful bow, the pre-fight jollof rice)
