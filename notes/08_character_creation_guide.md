# Character Creation Guide

## Purpose

This is the practical creator's guide for building new AFL fighters. Where
`02_fighter_system.md` defines the stat categories, archetypes, and profile structure
(the WHAT), this document provides the step-by-step process and decision frameworks
(the HOW).

Use this as a checklist every time a new fighter is created.

## Core Philosophy — Read This First

Everything below flows from these four principles. If a new character violates any of
them, stop and rework.

### 1. Female Characters Are Sexy and That's the Point

Design for a predominantly male audience. Female fighters should be charismatic, attractive,
and this should be **blatantly obvious in their outfit and gear design**. Crop tops, high-cut
leotards, sling bikinis, thongs, thigh-highs, mesh panels, cameltoe, pokies, loose shirts with no bra,
short skirts, loin cloths, semi-transparency, body paint — lean into it without apology. Sex appeal
is a feature, not a bug. Confidence, allure, and willingness to weaponize beauty are core
to female character design in AFL.

### 2. Men Are Bigger and Stronger — Women Win Differently

Men should be physically larger and more powerful than women. **No female fighters whose
primary identity is being big and strong compared to the men.** Women compete through
seduction, charm, playing dirty, psychological warfare, debuffing, supernatural ability,
technical mastery, mysticism, poison, speed, precision — everything except raw physical
dominance. The size and strength gap is real and is part of what makes it interesting when
a woman beats a man twice her size through means other than out-muscling him.

### 3. Characters Are Interesting Because of Violence, Not Despite It

Attitude and personality alone don't make a character interesting. Magic alone doesn't make
a character interesting. What makes a character interesting is:

- **How they hurt others** — and how they feel about it. Do they enjoy it? Hate it? Feel
  nothing? Need it?
- **How they get hurt** — and how they react. Do they crumble? Get angry? Get quiet? Come
  back harder?

We want to know how they deal with hurting and being hurt - and not just physical hurt. Avoid purely
evil or purely good characters as a general rule. Keep 1-2 at most, and even those should
be 95/5 — the saint with one dark impulse, the monster with one shred of something human.

### 4. Steal From Everywhere — Archetypes From Popular Media

The roster shouldn't be 20 variations on "MMA fighter with magic." Reach into the full
vocabulary of popular media archetypes and bring them in pure form:

- **Technology**: Mech suits, cybernetic augmentation, powered armor, nanobots
- **Weapons**: Guns, blades, chains, exotic weaponry
- **Science**: Gene splicing, chemical enhancement, experimental drugs, combat stimulants
- **Faith**: Ancient Christian favor, divine wrath, holy warrior, exorcist
- **Subterfuge**: Poison, hypnotics, drugs, nerve agents, sleep darts
- **Tradition**: Ninja art, assassin training, monastery disciplines, tribal war magic
- **Pop culture pulls**: Find an archetype that works in anime, action movies, comics,
  video games, wrestling, mythology, or pulp fiction and ask "what does this look like
  as an AFL fighter?"

The best new characters often come from identifying a classic archetype from existing
media and translating it faithfully into the AFL world. A cyberpunk street samurai. A
voodoo priestess. A disgraced priest who fights with righteous fury. A cartel chemist
who poisons her opponents before the bell. These are more interesting starting points
than "fighter with unusual martial art."

## The Creation Workflow

Follow these 13 steps in order. Each step builds on the previous one.

### Step 1: Roster Audit

Before designing anything, check the existing roster for gaps and overlap. A new fighter
should fill a hole, not duplicate what's already covered.

**Check these categories against the current roster:**
- **Origins** — geographic diversity across continents
- **Fighting Styles** — variety of martial arts, technology, subterfuge, faith, etc.
- **Archetypes** — spread across Prodigy, Veteran, Monster, Technician, Wildcard, Mystic, Survivor, Seductress/Seductor, Experiment, Legacy
- **Body Types** — range from tiny to massive, lean to hulking
- **Alignments** — balance of face, heel, and tweener
- **Supernatural status** — mix of supernatural and non-supernatural fighters

**What to look for:** If your concept overlaps heavily with an existing fighter in origin
AND style AND archetype, pivot. Minor overlaps are fine — two grapplers from different
backgrounds with different archetypes is fine. Two chi-using Irish counter-strikers is not.

### Step 2: Narrative Need

Ask: what does the current story need?

- A new **villain** to threaten established faces?
- A **challenger** for the current title picture?
- A **faction recruit** for an understrength faction?
- A **prospect** with raw talent and unknown ceiling?
- A **jobber/gatekeeper** to test rising fighters against?
- A **wild card** to disrupt an ongoing arc?
- A **connection point** to introduce a new lore element?

The best new fighters serve an immediate narrative function AND have long-term story potential.

### Step 3: Concept Hook

Write one sentence that captures what makes this fighter unique. If you can't say it in
one sentence, the concept needs refinement.

**The best hooks often start with a recognizable archetype from popular media** — action
movies, anime, comics, video games, wrestling, mythology, pulp fiction — and translate it
into the AFL world. Don't default to "martial artist with magic." Think bigger.

Bad examples:
- "A strong fighter who uses magic" (generic, could be anyone)
- "A mysterious warrior from a hidden temple" (cliche without specificity)
- "A woman who is really strong and tough" (for female fighters, strength and toughness
  aren't the hook — see Core Philosophy #2)

> **For female characters specifically**: The hook should make clear why she's compelling
> to a male audience. Beauty, danger, allure, mystique, cleverness, cruelty, seduction —
> these are the ingredients. A woman who wins by out-muscling men is not an AFL concept.

### Step 4: Archetype Blend

Pick 2 from the 10 archetypes defined in `02_fighter_system.md`:

> Prodigy, Veteran, Monster, Technician, Wildcard, Mystic, Survivor, Seductress/Seductor,
> Experiment, Legacy

Identify which is **primary** (dominant personality/approach) and which is **secondary**
(adds texture and complication).

The blend should create internal tension. A Technician-Wildcard has a precise game plan
but an unpredictable streak. A Monster-Survivor is physically dominant but got here through
hardship, not privilege. The tension within the blend is where personality lives.

> **Gender rule for archetypes**: The Monster archetype — defined by being bigger, stronger,
> and more physically imposing than everyone else — is a **male archetype**. Female fighters
> should not be designed around physical dominance over men. Women can be Monsters in the
> sense of being terrifying or inhuman (think body horror, supernatural corruption), but not
> in the sense of "she's bigger and stronger than the men." Women win through seduction,
> technique, supernatural ability, psychological warfare, dirty tactics, speed, precision,
> poison, technology, or sheer force of will — not by out-muscling men.


### Step 5: Identity & Origin

- **Ring Name**: Should be instantly evocative. One or two words that conjure an image or
  feeling. A name like "Carrion King" or "The Duchess" tells you everything. If the
  ring name needs explanation, it's not working.
- **Real Name**: Should feel authentic to the character's cultural background. Research
  naming conventions for their origin.
- **Age**: Affects physical peak, experience, and story potential. Under 25 = still
  developing. 25-32 = peak. 33+ = declining physically, peaking mentally.
- **Hometown**: Specific is better than vague. "Darwin, Northern Territory, Australia" is
  better than "Australia." The hometown should inform personality.
- **Affiliation**: Independent, or tied to an existing faction/organization? Options include
  The Ashen Circle, Project Zarya, Halo Labs, La Maison, The Iron Temple, government
  enhancement programs, or something new.

### Step 6: Physical Design

See the **Visual Design Principles** section below. This step produces the full physical
description: build, skin, hair, eyes, distinguishing features, ring attire, entrance style.

> **For female characters**: This is where sex appeal is designed in, not bolted on later.
> The outfit should be the statement — high-cut leotards, crop tops, sling bikinis, thongs, mesh
> panels, thigh-highs, micro shorts, plunging necklines. The outfit IS character design.
> A white leotard with plunging neckline tells you she's elegant and untouchable. A painted-on
> black ensemble tells you she's predatory. Don't design a female fighter in generic athletic
> wear and then try to make her interesting with magic effects. Design for a male audience.
> Make her visually arresting first.
>
> **For male characters**: Men should read as physically imposing, powerful, larger than the
> women. Shirtless, muscular, scarred, weathered, massive — the visual vocabulary of
> masculine threat. Male fighters carry danger in their physicality. Female fighters carry
> it in everything else.


### Step 13: Image Generation Notes

Write pixel art portrait direction following the established format:
1. Physical details (build, skin, hair, eyes, distinguishing features)
2. Outfit description (ring attire, accessories)
3. Expression directive (what emotion/attitude should read)
4. Background directive (color palette, mood, thematic elements)

Every entry starts with "Pixel art portrait:" and emphasizes human qualities first.

## Visual Design Principles

### The Strip Test

> Remove all supernatural effects from the character. Are they still visually compelling
> and distinct through human qualities alone? If not, the design needs more work.

This is the single most important design principle. Every fighter must pass it.

A chi fighter without the glow should still be a tiny, intense woman with an asymmetric
haircut, white hand wraps, and an unsettling stare. Compelling. An aristocrat without any
magical element should still be a statuesque blonde in a white leotard and thigh-highs
smirking at you like you're beneath her. Compelling.

If your character is only interesting because they glow, they are not interesting.

### Human Qualities Carry the Design

What makes a character visually memorable is always human:

- **Expression**: A cold intellectual appraisal. A feral grin. Dead calm. Righteous
  stillness. The face tells the story.
- **Outfit**: Ring attire expresses personality louder than any magical effect. A white
  leotard with gold filigree says "I'm at a gala, not a cage fight." Ripped denim shorts
  and ratty Converse say "I came here to break things." An olive sports bra and khaki
  shorts say "I'm here to work." Immaculate white-and-gold says "I'm already better
  than you."
- **Body language**: How they carry themselves. A warrior's posture. A deliberate hip
  roll. Coiled, restless scanning. Focused shadowboxing.
- **Physicality**: Body type tells a story. A massive gut hiding slabs of core muscle.
  A coiled-spring wiry frame. Weathered, dense muscle. An angular, forged-by-hardship build.
- **Style details**: Scars, tattoos, jewelry, hair choices. A keloid scar and gold-tipped
  locs. Gold-thread braids. A crocodile scar and twice-broken nose. These are the details
  fans remember.

### Silhouette Rule

A well-designed fighter is recognizable from their outline alone. A massive frame with
flowing hair is distinct from a hunched, gut-forward silhouette. A small, spiky profile
is distinct from a compact, ponytailed shape.

Test: describe the character's silhouette in one sentence. If it sounds like someone
else on the roster, differentiate further.

### Sex Appeal — Especially for Female Characters

This is not optional. This is core to the product. AFL is designed for a predominantly
male audience and female characters should be designed accordingly.

**For every female fighter, the outfit and physical design should be overtly sexy.** This
means:

- **Revealing outfits are the default**: High-cut leotards, plunging necklines, sling
  bikinis, crop tops showing underboob, micro shorts, mesh panels, thigh-highs, painted-on
  bodysuits, micro bikinis, cameltoe, pokies, loose shirts with no bra, short skirts, 
  loin cloths, semi-transparency, body paint. The outfit should turn heads. 
- **Physique matters**: Athletic, toned, curves emphasized. Different body types are fine
  (petite, hourglass, athletic, compact) but all should be attractive. No female fighter
  should be designed to be visually unremarkable.
- **Confidence amplifies everything**: Amused condescension. A predatory smile. Cold
  clinical beauty. The attitude in the eyes and the body language multiply the visual
  impact of the outfit.
- **The outfit IS the character**: An aristocrat in a standard sports bra and shorts
  loses her identity. A genius in anything less than immaculate couture loses hers.
  The outfit choice reveals personality as much as any dialogue.

**For male fighters**, sex appeal comes through physicality — sculpted builds, shirtless by
default, chiseled jaws, imposing frames. A magazine-cover body. Greek-god proportions.
Terrifying mass.

**What NOT to do**: Use "faint [color] energy emanates from their body" or "an aura of
desire radiates outward" as a substitute for actual visual design. Don't sanitize female
designs into modest athletic wear because it feels "safer" or "more realistic." This is a
fantasy fighting league inspired by Mortal Kombat and Street Fighter, not a UFC simulation.
Lean in.

### Distinguishing Features

Every fighter needs at least 1 unique physical detail that fans latch onto:

- Scars (a keloid across the jaw, a crocodile-bite scar, an eyebrow-to-cheekbone slash)
- Tattoos (full irezumi sleeves, Adinkra symbols, a snake on the ring finger)
- Heterochromia or unusual eyes (mismatched green/olive, amber-gold, solid white)
- Hair (a hot pink buzzcut, gold-thread braids, an asymmetric cut with a white streak)
- Body quirks (a missing pinky tip, a chipped tooth, scarred and calcified fists)


### What NOT to Do

These patterns were identified during the roster rework and removed:

| Removed Pattern | What Replaced It |
|---|---|
| "Faint emerald energy wisps around her hands" | Celtic knotwork sleeve tattoos that seem to shift in low light |
| "An aura of supernatural allure radiates from her" | "Too-perfect proportions, cold clinical beauty — disturbing, not enchanting" |
| "Mystical golden light surrounds his fists" | Faint shimmer around fists "that could be sweat catching the light, or something else" |
| "Her eyes glow with psychic power" | "Cool, appraising dark brown eyes with cutting intellectual intensity" |
| Generic "energy crackling" as identity | Specific human details (scars, expression, outfit, posture) |

The rule: supernatural effects are **one optional ingredient**, never the main course.
When present, they should be subtle, ambiguous, or grounded in something physical (tattoos
that seem to move, veins that darken, eyes that catch light strangely).


## Common Mistakes

1. **Sanitizing female character designs.** This is the #1 most likely failure mode. The
   AI generating characters will instinctively pull toward modest athletic wear, "practical"
   outfits, and de-sexualized designs for women. Fight this. Female fighters in AFL wear
   revealing, attention-grabbing outfits by design. If a female character's outfit could
   pass in a real UFC broadcast, it's too conservative. Think Mortal Kombat, Dead or Alive,
   Street Fighter — not ESPN.

2. **Making a female fighter whose identity is "big and strong."** Women in AFL do not
   compete with men on physicality. No female character should be designed around being
   physically imposing relative to the male roster. If the concept is "she's really strong
   and tough," it's a male character concept. Rethink the character around seduction,
   mysticism, technology, poison, psychological warfare, technical mastery, or supernatural
   ability.

3. **Making every character clearly good or clearly evil.** The roster should be
   overwhelmingly grey. Characters who hurt people and feel complicated about it. Characters
   who do bad things for understandable reasons. Characters who do good things for selfish
   reasons. At most 1-2 characters at the moral extremes, and even those get a 5% crack in
   the armor.

4. **Defaulting to "martial artist with supernatural power."** The roster already has
   plenty of these. New characters should explore technology, weapons, science, faith,
   poison, drugs, hypnotics, ninja tradition, mech suits, cybernetics, and other archetypes
   borrowed from popular media. If the concept is "[martial art] + [magical ability],"
   check whether the roster already has three of those and pivot to something with a
   different vocabulary.

5. **Generic glow effects as primary visual identity.** If the character's most notable
   visual feature is that they glow, redo the design. Pass the strip test.

6. **"Supernatural seduction" substituting for actual personality.** Seduction should work
   through specific human behaviors: how they dress, move, talk, look at you. "Mystical
   allure" without specific mechanism is lazy.

7. **No genuine weaknesses.** If you can't name 2-3 existing roster members who would give
   this fighter serious trouble, the weaknesses aren't real.

8. **Backstory disconnected from existing world.** A fighter whose history doesn't touch
   any existing character, faction, location, or lore element is floating in space. At least
   2 connections.

9. **Duplicate archetype/style in an already crowded slot.** Check the roster audit. If we
   already have three Prodigies, your Prodigy needs a strong reason to exist.

10. **Power levels that break matchup dynamics.** A new fighter shouldn't be unbeatable by
    anyone on the current roster. If you can't identify their bad matchups, they're
    overpowered.

11. **Overly complex supernatural systems for a new character.** A debut fighter should
    have 0-2 supernatural stats, not a bespoke magic system. Complexity is earned through
    narrative development, not character creation.

12. **Forgetting the strip test.** Remove the supernatural effects. Is the character still
    visually compelling, personality-rich, and distinct? If not, do more work on the human
    foundation before adding anything else.

13. **Cheap diversity.** Don't add geographic/cultural origins just to check boxes. A
    fighter from Nigeria should exist because Lagos street fighting culture creates an
    interesting character, not because "we don't have anyone from Africa." The origin must
    serve the character concept. Tokenism is boring.
